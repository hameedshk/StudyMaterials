ðŸ”§ How Base64 Works â€” Step-by-Step
1. Input is grouped in 3 bytes = 24 bits
Example:
M a n â†’ 01001101 01100001 01101110

2. Split the 24 bits into four 6-bit groups
010011 010110 000101 101110

3. Each 6-bit group maps to a Base64 character
Using this table:

Index	Char
0â€“25	Aâ€“Z
26â€“51	aâ€“z
52â€“61	0â€“9
62	+
63	/

4. Result is 4 Base64 characters
Example:
"Man" â†’ TWFu

^(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{4})+(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=)?$

Base64 output is always a multiple of 4 characters.

This is a fundamental rule of Base64 encoding:

Every valid Base64 string length must be divisible by 4
No exceptions

Base64 works like this:

It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) of input.

It splits those 24 bits into 4 groups of 6 bits.

Each 6-bit group is mapped to 1 Base64 character.

So:

3 bytes â†’ 4 Base64 characters

6 bytes â†’ 8 Base64 characters

9 bytes â†’ 12 Base64 characters
â€¦and so on.
