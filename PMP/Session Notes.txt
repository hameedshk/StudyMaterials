Team Charter

Objectives: This is what we aim to attain through this class and its
  results - 

  * Obtain our PMP
  * Get through this entire content
  * Obtain our Simplilearn certificate so we can apply for the exam
  * Establish a solid preparation plan.
  * Learn something that helps us continue to move forward in our careers


Ground Rules
  Values
  * Responsibility - take ownership for decisions we make, actions we take,
	and consequences as these outcomes.

  * Respect - Show a high regard for *OURSELVES* others, and what's entrusted
	to us.

  * Fairness - Make decisions and act impartially and objectively.
	I don't want my opinion to be right, I want to hear ALL opinions
	and work with you to find the best one.

  * Honesty - Understand the truth. Act and speak in a truthful manner.
	We find out what's right and we speak of it and do it.

	**** We leave no one behind. Everyone crosses the finish line together.

  * Communications: We take statements and comments in chat as opinions and
    perceptions, not facts or truths. Even facts, without analysis, are not truth.

    We use debate to negotiate and come to agreement.

    Opinions and perceptions may be wrong; PEOPLE are not wrong.

    We embrace the truth. Being right doesn't get us closer to the truth; being
    wrong Does get us closer to the truth.

    "Greater clarification and transparency, less confusion."
	(Precision in our definitions)

  * Responsibility - we own our personal growth. This class requires not only
    acquisition of knowledge, but changes in perception and habit. 

    This includes a sense that we will be confused and frustrated. We accept 
    that this is just part of the process, and evidence we are doing this right.
	"All Growth is on the other side of Resistance" - Ryan Holiday
	'If you're frustrated, you're on the right path' - Tim

    60% of your learning will be received through observing how Tim leads, manages,
	and organizes the class. This class is intended to not be a lecture, but an
	immersive experience. Relax, take a breath, and think a little slower, and
	you'll see the patterns emerge.

Introduction (PMI Content)
	The application process
	I talk through this once
	I discuss it post-session from then on
	it is recorded and notes are shared.

	to apply you need to documen t experience leading projects.
	* you don't need the Title Project Manager
	* you don't need to be the assigned PM.

	* you merely need to have performed "the tasks of a PM"
		{Exam Content Outline}

Document the 'projects' you worked on in the last 3-8 years
	* unique	(requires its own plan)
	* time-bound	(specific start, end)

PMI is not interested in "operations" (repeats, ongoing)

	Review the tasks in the Exam Content Outline and use that
	as a template

	* What does PMI recommend in our applications?

PMI requires that qualified PMP candidates:

* Perform their duties under general supervision and are responsible 
  for all aspects of the project for the life of the project
* Lead and direct cross-functional teams to deliver projects within 
  the constraints of schedule, budget and resources
* Demonstrate sufficient knowledge and experience to appropriately 
  apply a methodology to projects that have reasonably well-defined 
  project requirements and deliverables.

Project descriptions should consist of the following:

* A brief, one-sentence project objective
* Project deliverables summarized by process areas 
  (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing - 
   abbreviations are acceptable IN, PL, EX, MC &amp; CL)

	IN	gaining project approval
	PL	Planning
	EX	Executing, team does the work, PM manages
	MC	Monitoring & Controlling, analysis and decision-making
	CL	Closing

* A brief, one-sentence project outcome

Project descriptions should be a high level summary of the tasks 
you led and directed on the project (e.g. Initiating: develop project 
charter etc.; Planning: Scope definition etc.; and so on). 

Project management experience is required in each of the process areas 
when all projects are totaled, but not on each project. 

Project descriptions must be provided for all projects submitted on 
application.

At end of class I'll also share with you an example... 

* Some of you don't have confidence even though you have experience.
	Contact support, ask for learning success to receive your application
	to review. We review it when we are able.

	You build, we will review.
	You build, we will review.
	You build, we will review.

What is the turn around time we need to keep in mind for the review
	I have no possible idea. Currently I have 5 in my queue, and
	it takes between 2 and 8 hours each for me to go through
	each application. Luckily there are others who do this as well.

	When to start this? Start it now.
	Get it out of the way. 
	* Go to the pmi PMP exam application site, login in, and start.

Who do I get for a reference?
	someone in higher authority, understands the work and is willing to vouch
	your manager/supervisor, sponsor, client, etc.

	PMI does not recognize peers, team members.

	If you can't find one (example - the business closed)
	contact PMI - they help others resolve this constantly, and can help you.

	Many people see PM formal training as a small quick way to learn
	basic MBA concepts

	you learn basic concepts in PM formal training
	You learn to be an expert in business with graduate degrees.

	We have different habits, opinions, and perceptions
	we use debate to learn to agree.

Tomorrow: we start on sl. 10, introduction, and immediatley
get into the content.

- What do I need to do for this class right now?
------------------------------------------------
* Start a journal, write down the topics that confuse you.

* Download, organize content you have access to. Review it
  for future reference.

* Start the self-learning content now. See if you can stay
  ahead of the slides we cover in class. Again, capture the
  topics and concepts you don't understand.

* We'll get into out-of-class assignments and practice
  questions soon enough; for now, get in a routine of 
  regularly attending and reviewing class.

*****

From	Sec. 1, sl.   1
To	Sec. 1, sl. ..?

====================================================
Creating a High-Performing Team

	This material is often very confusing (especially section 1)
	You will wonder why we are bouncing around.

	Treat this like an agile project.

	Traditional ("predictive") PM:
	'We've done this before - we can build a plan.'

	Agile PM:
	'We've never done this before; we need to work
	 as a group, and create a high-level plan we can
		use to explore the work early.'

	Agile projects start like starting a picture puzzle:
		1) open the box
		2) get all the pieces on the table
		3) start sorting them.

	THIS is what we are doing with section 1.
	* Lots of definitions
	* lots of concepts
	* a few 'sides and corners' we'll set aside.

	To make this process even easier...
	I have a dashboard.

* Build a Team
	Project:	unique	(needs its own plan)
			time-bound (specific start, end)

	Operations:	repeats, ongoing

	Project Management (PM): the activities of organizing,
		guiding, facilitating the creation of a deliverable.

	Resource management:
	Management of resources on a project
		Human		"Team"
		Physical	Materials	nuts, bolts, cabling
				tools		shovels, heavy construction
						equipment
				supplies	cases of bottled water

	Team:		Does the work of creating the deliverable
	PM:		Ensures Deliverable meets objective

			Orchestra members play the music; the 
			conductor leads.

			The ship's crew does the work; the captain
			guides the crew in how to do that work well.

	Deliverable:	something the project hands over or delivers
			product (physical)
			service (action)
			result  (outcome)

	Objective:	purpose, "why"

			This class is introducing you to formal PM concepts.
				Deliverable
			It is intended to provide you a foundation for
			passing your exam.
				Objective


* (Human) Resource Management
* Project Team
	Effective:	serves its Purpose.
	Effective Meeting
	Effective Team
	Effective Email
	Effective Project

	We create a work environment such that it makes it easy
	for people to get their work done.

* Project Team Requirements
	PM ensures training and mentoring and coaching are available

	- Competency:
		- skill:	actions performed in the work
				"Build a spreadsheet", "create
				 a process" (process improvement)

		- KNowledge:	information needed to perform work
				'Where is that template?'
				'Who can grant us access to confidential
				 information

		- Attributes	behavior and character required to do work
				Responsibility: noone has to tell me to get to work
				Accountability: I care about the outcome
				Self-awareness
				Emotional Intelligence
				...
				...

	We desire to have teams of 
	"General Specialists"

	Specialist	an expert in their area (about 5-6 years of regular
			work here)

	General		they work well together as a team

		Sports: football (soccer in the US)
		Specialist:	Runners, kickers, blockers

		General		runners can support kickers, blockers
				kickers can support runners, blockers
				blockers can support kickers, runners

	Specialists can rely on skills, knowledge.
	General specialists have to also rely on ATTRIBUTES (attitude, behavior)
						 MIND SET

	The PM:		- ensures the environment is free from disruption,
			  distraction
			- so great work can be done by good teams

* Stakeholder
	individual, group, entity
	* May impact my work
	* May be impacted by my work
	* May perceive to be impacted by my work


	May impact my work
		People who will use my deliverable
		Team members (they certainly impact it)
		Janitor - they clean the lab behind the test servers...

	May be impacted by my work
		Admins who are influenced by the changes my project makes
		IT organization: they will have to support whatever I create.

	May perceive to be impacted by my work
		IT Organization: they think my project will eliminate 
		their jobs (it won't, but that's what they perceive)

	Positive:	may influence my work in a good way	"supportive"
	Negative:	may influence my work in a bad way

		I have to get ahead of this and control.

"Does it mean opinion making or perception management?"
	It means that we are responsible for 
	- negotiation
	- persuasion
	- motivation

	We need to 
		- identify: know as many stakeholders as we can
		- analyze: understand needs, expectations and
		  level of engagement
		- engage: in order to help them become supportive
				"Involve". To the 'appropriate' level

* Stakeholder Identification
	it starts with your obvious, high-level stakeholders
	- you create a contact list.
	- you capture information about the contacts to understand them.
	- you continue to build out this information constantly...

	We analyze and document. We think it's 'soft skills', but it
	is specific, and measurable, and quantifiable.



	Project document:	'container of project information'
				email, text file, ppt, word doc, etc etc etc

	What's an artifact?
		* template
	->	* project document
		* update
		* deliverable

Stakeholder Register
	- project document
	- contains
		* stakeholders
		* relevant information we need in order to engage


* Stakeholder Register
	Internal stakeholders - include:
	you (PM)
	Team
	Experts
	Sponsor	<-?

	Sponsor:	Primary decision-maker
			provides resources, funding


* RACI Chart
	If we use stakeholder register to organize stakeholders,
	what do we use to organize our teams, experts?

	"Resource Assignment Matrix (RAM)"
		- project document
		- organizes my human resources
		- by connecting specific people <=== !!!
		  to specific tasks

	RACI - one type of Resource Assignment matrix

	This is only one TYPE of RAM.
	There are many others. Your organization probably calls it
	differently (this is what we learn in business school)
	Academic, academic model, academic reference.

	RACI Chart (Acronym)
	R esponsible	"I perform the work"	(team member, stakeholders)
	A ccountable	"I LEAD the work"	(team lead, sometimes even PM)
	C onsulted	"I am an expert"	(SMEs, team)
	I nformed	"I need information"	(team member, stakeholders, expert/s)

	team member: does the work of the project
	Stakeholder: can impact, be impacted, perceive to be impacted

	Team members are a small set within the greater set of stakeholders
	sponsor is also a stakeholder
	PM (you) - also a stakeholder

	* Each task will have one (only one) 'Accountable'
	* 'Accountable' CAN include 'Responsible' <- for this class and the exam.
		"The team lead can also participate in tyhe work"
	* 'A' and 'R' can ask 'C' questions (C is my expert for this task)
	* 'A' must ensure 'I' gets information from the task
		- I may be outside the team and needs for business
		- I may be inside the team and needs for other tasks




	R,A	<- defines how the work is assigned
	C,I	<- defines how the information will flow
		Consulted:	experts who provide judgment (and expertise)
		Informed:	stakeholders needing information from project

Should PM be all RACI?
	This is undefined (treat it as 1/0)

	A,R are confusing to us for a reason
		Defined one way in RACI
		Defined another way in Leadership
		They will remain this way.

	For general leadership definitions
	Responsible	noone has to tell that person to get work done
	Accountable	they Care about the result
		(with effort, this fits nicely into the RACI use of R,A) 


Is RASCI or RACI the right acronymn?
	yes and yes - they're all correct.
	Organizations tend to tailor these tools.

	OUR RACI chart will take the form of academic models

"Any imprtant decision related to activity falls under A or C? "
	regretfully, we don't have time for all these questions.
	I have to stay on topic, and will complete all the concepts

	I focus on
	* Fundamentals
	* how they fit together


	There is difference between job titles and roles.
		PM 		role
		Team member	role
		Product owner	...	(both role and job title)
		developer/testerjob title

		solution architect	job title

	The roles defined in our framework
			PM
			Team
			Stakeholder
			Sponsor
			(product owner)
		Role:	"A set of tasks"
			 performed by one or more individual, entity, group

* Team Skills Appraisal
	Strengths 	- this is the area people are expert in.
			they spent a lot of time getting good.
			they even spent time off the clock.

	Weaknesses	- EVERYONE has a weakness - even the most
			strong person.

	It's our job to if possible align people with work that
	utilizes the strengths and minimizes accentuating weaknesses.

	We make it easy for people to do great work.

	Understand humans, behavior - it can be both easy and fun
	to get work done.

	Culture:	"unwritten rules and policies that define a group."
		Tom Peters: "Culture eats process for breakfast."

Pre-assignment skills

	Assignment: formal placement of resources to a project.
		* the manager of the team members will assign
		  The PM will negotiate

		PM and resources' managers will come to an agreement
		based on PM's power/authority, the PM will get the
		resources for the project.

	Pre-assignment assesment - this requires some skills.
	Before or after I have these team members assigned, how do I
	determine - their skills, knowledge, attributes?

	For tomorrow, we review the first assignment tools and then
	complete the slide...






- What do I need to do for this class right now?
------------------------------------------------
* Start a journal, write down the topics that confuse you.

* Download, organize content you have access to. Review it
  for future reference.

* Start the self-learning content now. See if you can stay
  ahead of the slides we cover in class. Again, capture the
  topics and concepts you don't understand.

* We'll get into out-of-class assignments and practice
  questions soon enough; for now, get in a routine of 
  regularly attending and reviewing class.
====================================================
8:09 AM 11/30/2022

Standup: 	What is the talent triangle, 
		why is it important?
		(p. 58, Proc Grp PG)



		How can I be successful in this class?
		How do I keep up?

		Proper attitude to use this class.
		Day sessions are really short.

		* treat the active class like a high-impact
		  exercise. Get right to work 'when the music
		  starts'.
		* WE 'go to the juice bar' after class over
		  to discuss tips and tricks and questions
		  not answered.
		* between classes, we 'stretch' and 'relax'.
		  we capture the details we missed in notes,
		  and write them up for more analysis.
			* asking tim
			* further review
			* discussions on the forum.


*****
From:	Sec. 1, sl.  17 skills appraisal
To:	Sec. 1, sl.  54 Lessons Learned Register

* Pre-Assignment Tools
	Assignment

	* There is someone in charge of every worker in a company.
	  This is the one who assigns.

	* THe PM 'negotiates'
		* they assess the project need
		* they request the resource from the functional manager/s

	there may be a way to assess the resources even before assignment.
	(think about job interviews)

Focus Groups
	- pre-qualified stakeholders, experts (and potential team members)
	- expectations, attitudes of a deliverable
	- a facilitated discussion for rounded information gathering

	You're interviewing for a database expert.
	You specifically need schema designers.

* Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

	Diversity:	I need people to be different.
			I need options (alternatives)

	People the same? 1 idea.

	WIth differences in people, I get conflict.
	(that's all right, I can teach them conflict management).

	Equity:		each person has one vote
			each vote weighs the same.

		without this, people are not providing the best
		they can. Engagement REQUIRES equity

	Inclusion:	EVERYONE will provide input.
			Even the craziest ideas can inspire
			great ideas.

			With inclusion, we get engagement
			and COMMITMENT.

* Resource Management Plan
	Plan - "How we will..."

	- how we will
	* identify, assign, train, manage, develop human resources
	* identify, acquire, monitor, control physical resources

* Virtual Teams
	- we have all developed expertise in working remotely
	- we now get to explore managing remote workers *and* virtual teams

	What we have learned:
		*) remote workers have the same needs
		   office workers do

		*) as managers we need to determine
		   how to meet those needs
		   within constraints of remote working tools

	Kanban boards (we'll discuss these in great detail later)
		Kanban board: a 'type' of task board
		a scheduling tool in Agile.

	Information Radiator
	- Information: organized, analyzed data, used for 
			control (decisions, further analysis, review, etc)

	- Radiator:	distributes something (heat, cooling, humidity
						*and* information)

	Information - dashboard
	Radiator    - webex
		      shared network drive
		      a monitor in the work area we can see from our desks

		Information is what the team needs
		Radiators "send out" that information in order
			 	for everyone to receive

	Why? A PM is responsible for ensuring people have what they need to
		get their work done well.

	PMBOK - good practice (A 'STANDARD')
	rules, policies and laws - NOT.
	"We figured out how to do this work well, and if you do it this
	 way, you'll get better results."


* Assign Project Responsibilities
	This gives people a bit of control.
	(safety, autonomy/a little control, fulfillment)
		Give these to a person, and they are more engaged.

	If people contribute to work, they care about the work
	(it has a 'bit of them' in it) 

	- Tailoring
	The deliberate adaptation
	of approach, governance, and processes
	to make them more suitable
	for the given environment and work at hand

	What I deliver to you is not rules and 'you have to'.
	It is "good practice"
		* This has worked well in the past
		* If you do it this way, you'll get better results.

	Some organizations for their own reasons don't adopt
	good practice. This is fine.

	Traditional PM: it's an exercise in matching people to roles

	Agile PM: it's an understanding that everything is unknown
			and even that can change.

			We invest in relationships.
			WE collaborate, we facilitate

			We embrace 'self-organizing' teams.

	By taking advantage of human nature, work gets really easy.
		Allow team members to select tasks,
		they have the chance of working what they're good at
		they have a chance of not working on what they don't

	Inclusion and fairness as well.

* Rates
	Rates:	not all same for all resources.
		Not only costs in money, but also costs in time

* Resource Assignment
* Nurturing Team Performance

	3 critical indicators
		"Key Performance Indicators" 
	we use for anlyzing and understanding the project:
		1) general schedule, budget and scope
			"progress of the work"
		2) team and its results
			"contributions of the Team"
		3) contributions and engagement of team members

		1	-> Group and its behavior
		2	-> Individual and its behavior

	Individuals do not create the work
	TEAM               creates the work
	Individuals contribute to the team


* Knowledge Transfer

	Lesson Learned:	an innovation
	has a chance of improving this or other projects.

  Transfer of knowledge allows different ideas to create
	new ideas.

	Issue: many team members think
		"If I keep this knowledge to myself,
		 I am now powerful."

		One problem, over time, knowledge loses value.

	Solution:	1) let's share knowledge
			2) let's create new knowledge
			3) everyone wins

		Instead of killing ideas by not sharing
		we contribute to a constant source of innovation

	It is our job as leader to inspire, support and ensure
	we create innovations (lessons learned)

Define Team Ground Rules
* Team Norms
	Team Norms: 'expected "normal" behavior
		    we need to work as a team.

	Ground Rules: fundamental rules we agree to
			in order to work as a team.

* PMI Code of Ethics
	Ethics		Right and wrong
	Morals		Behavior built on, guided by right and wrong

https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/ethics/pmi-code-of-ethics.pdf?v=6af21906-e593-4b63-8cee-abeb4137f41d&sc_lang_temp=en

Integrity:	words and actions say the same thing.
		When they don't, we have dissonance (confusion).

	1) we don't make people wrong. When we make people wrong, they feel shame,
	   and no longer contribute.

	2) People are like hammers.
		A hammer is designed perfectly for one action:
		- drive a nail into that wood.

		Its design also makes it really good to break windows.
		- that does not make the hammer bad.

		It's the hand behind the hammer that decides the action
		of bad, good.

		People are like hammers.
		what is the 'hand behind the hammer' of people?
			Our perceptions and opinions
			based on habits
			based on principles
			based on values

	3) I don't want to change people. They are perfectly crafted.
	   I merely need behaviors, and actions to change.

		* I can't do this. Noone can change these of others.
		* we all are responsible for changing our own.

	We are whistle blowers.
		those who raise ethical concerns at risk of great sacrifice.
	
	* YOu cannot expect to have to make the right decision.
	  I'm not asking you to put your job at risk.

	I'm asking you to be prepared - it will happen.
	Decide before this happens how you will respond.

	* have very good mentors: seasoned experts who you can confided
	  in who will give you support and help you decide.
	* know your options, and actions you will take.
	* Be kind to yourself.

	We protect whistle blowers.

Tomorrow: WE finish code of ethics
	starting with honesty...



====================================================
8:11 AM 12/1/2022

Standup: Great remote working company to observe: Github!

Our first practice question:
	1. It's ethics
	2. We first work out a routine for solving questions
	3. We turn that routine into an automatic habit

	Context:	What is the surrounding, background information?
			WE can't go beyond this, can't add or remove from this.

	Real question:	What is the question really asking us?

	Options and variances


Look for my preparation process in the FAQ, we'll go over details
next week.


You are taking a part of your project out for bid. Your director said, 
"use this person's company - he's a neighbor and has a great reputation,
and we've been successful with his work before." You will... [select one]

	Context:	we are a buyer on a contract.
			We are in negotiations

			Director: use my friend (ethics?)
			He's a great worker     (opinion)

	Real		What do you do? What's next? What's the best?
	Question:	What's the least worst?




a - Tell your director this is unethical, and ensure that this behavior is
    known to be unacceptable to the recommended vendor.

b - Tell your director "thanks" and add this vendor to the selection list.

c - Tell your director "thanks".

d - Wait to see if your director forgets that he recommended his neighbor.



	a - puts your director's relationship with you at risk.
	    probably the right thing to do. sigh.

	    Brings the vendor into the issue.

	b - polite ("Thanks"). Add the vendor to the list.
		We'll learn later, YOU don't add vendors to the
		potential sell list. It's their responsibility
		to add themselves. (every other vendor had to do it - ethics)

	c - polite. Nothing more. This is what we call complacency.

	d - complacency, AND unethical.

	I don't like any of these.



	Simple rules for answering questions on the exam:
	* Ethics will come first. Choose ethics.
	* Analyze before you decide. (look for the option that
	  suggests analysis)
	* go to team, experts for input, decisions.
	* Complacency is NEVER the answer



	we will have to choose the LEAST WORST.

	We must go with ONE Option. We have to choose within these boundaries.

	least worst to me or to company? To the project.
	and it is assumed the project is within laws and policies of corporation.

	A is the correct answer.
	a - puts your director's relationship with you at risk.
	    probably the right thing to do. sigh.

	Process of elimination.

a - Tell your director this is unethical, and ensure that this behavior is
    known to be unacceptable to the recommended vendor.

b - Tell your director "thanks" and add this vendor to the selection list.

c - Tell your director "thanks".

d - Wait to see if your director forgets that he recommended his neighbor.

	Does d make the project better or keep it from failure?
	Does c make the project better or keep it from failure?
	Does b make the project better or keep it from failure?
		sort of (this is a grey option)
		HOWEVER, it's not only ethically wrong, but it
		is also procedurally wrong. Talk to purchasing
		and legal, and they'll slap your hand.
		This DOES NOT make the project better or keep it
		from failure.

	We don't like A. We don't like going to the vendor. But
	this is ethically correct, and with the other options,
	we *MUST* select it. And it hurts (sacrifice - our ego)

	A is the correct answer.

	This is how you will answer questions on the exam.
	180 questions, 1.3 minutes per question. It will take
	practice, you will turn into a question-answering machine.
	










*****
From:	Sec. 1, sl.  31
		     37
To:	Sec. 1, sl.  68

* PMI Code of Ethics
* Team Charter
* Ground Rules

* Team Norms
	Team Norms: 'expected "normal" behavior
		    we need to work as a team.

	Ground Rules: fundamental rules we agree to
			in order to work as a team.

* Negotiation Skills
	Agreement:	we share the same idea
	Negotiation:	an attempt to come to agreement
	- we can argue
	- we can debate	a negotiation, which uses
			logic
			ethics
			emotion

* Internal & External Communication
* Conflict Management

	- Conflict: clash of interest. Routine group interaction is first
	  disrupted by an initial conflict, often caused by differences of
	  opinion, disagreements between members, scarcity of resources.1

	- CONFLICT IS NOT BAD. Uncontrolled conflict is.

	Confrontation is scary - the first time.
	It's like a gladiator going into the arena - the first time.

	* conflict has behavioral considerations. This is what makes it tricky.
		We connect our emotions to our opinions.
		We therefore are invested in our opinions.
			attack my opinions? You attack my person.
			Make my opinions wrong? you make Me wrong.

		We must embrace strategies that
		* minimize conflict
		* re-direct the emotions to solving the issue that
		  represents the conflict


* Manage & Rectify Ground Rule Violations
	* If you're worried that you have to remove a team member,
	  you're too late.

	* You need to be terribly proactive.
	- Have a GREAT relationship with their functional/operational manager.
	- have regular communications with their functional/operational manager.
	- Have open communications regularly with your direct reports.
	- start off with questions, not statements.
		pause after each question. Let them feel they need to fill		
		the gap with words.
	- find a common ground, and build from this. Find a solution
	  together that determines success in changing actions, behaviors.

	- the objective: if the behavior, action cannot change, it will be
	  an agreement between the team member, you, the management that this
	  is a better option than the team member stays on the project.


Negotiate Project Agreements
* Project Agreement Objectives
* Agreements
* Negotiations
* Negotiation Strategy
	Agile strategy:	We have an objective (purpose)
	and we use a broad understanding of the work to
	set our course, 
	
		and then we continually correct that course.

	Traditional strategy: you know the objective and
		the steps to get there.

		AND then you have formal change control,
			PLUS
		continuous improvement (lessons learned)

* Prioritization Techniques
	Moscow ('MSCW') technique
	a more general technique you can use to prioritze everything

	M ust		if we don't, it leads to failure
	S hould		Possibly won't fail, but we'll miss some objectives
	C ould		Additional value, but not greatly impactful
	W on't		We need to disregard this - for now

	Let's prioritize our objectives for this class using MSCW Technique
	
	MUST  * Obtain our PMP
 	SHOULD * Get through this entire content
	COULD  * Obtain our Simplilearn certificate so we can apply for the exam
  	COULD * Establish a solid preparation plan.
	COULD  * Learn something that helps us continue to move forward in our careers
	Won't  (if we don't have time)

* Kano Model
	Breaks down quality definitions of a project into 5
	categories:
		When our experts start defining quality,
		we can bring this template out...

	* Must-be - customers expect these and take them for
	  granted.
		'seatbelts in a car'


	* 1-dimensional - result in satisfaction when fulfilled,
	  result in dissatisfaction when unfulfilled.
		'radio in the car'

	* Attractive - result in satisfaction when fulfilled,
	  do NOT result in dissatisfaction when unfulfilled.
		'a map in the dashboard'
		(If it's not there, I still have a map on
		my smartphone)

	* Indifferent - neither good, or bad, don't result in
	  satisfaction or dissatisfaction
		the carpet in the car has 3/4" fibres, not 
		1/2" fibers

	* Reverse - by satisfying some, dissatisfy others.
		A totally pink interior

	Prioritization can be simple or complex
	based on the consideration and importance of what
	you're prioritizing.	
	


* Performance Reports (p. 23, Proc. Grp PG)
	We negotiate how we turn data into information into reports.

	How do we control? WE turn data into information and use the
	reports to make decisions.

We have to discuss a model for how we do this on every project.
	
	"Work performance"	<- the work the team does
				 	- it creates the deliverable
					- it creates the data

	* Data		Raw, without context (supporting, background detail)
			"We spent $5,000 last week."
			Is this good, bad? We don't know.

	* Information	Data, Analyzed in Context
			"We are now $400 over budget."
			WE now know - 'this is bad'.

	* Reports	Formatted information
			Used For Control
			{Dashboard}


====================================================
8:21 AM 12/2/2022

Standup: For Monday...?

*****

From: Sec. 1, sl.  49
To:   Sec. 1, sl.  86 

* Expert Judgment
* Resource Calendars

		"Availability of my team"
		 (when they're available)
		"Availability of my vendor/s (outsourcing)"

	This is valuable.
	I Have my estimated schedule,
	I compare this to my resource calendars,
	I then identify and resolve gaps.

(Agile)
	all of section 1 is not only preferred, but often critical
	for adaptive life cycles.

	IN traditional life cycles, "beneficial"


* REview Team Performance &
  Identify Lessons Learned
* Lessons Learned Register (& Repository)
	Lessons Learned Register
		- project document
		- we use to capture lessons learned
		- for the benefit of this project

	Lessons learned Repository
		- A knowledge base
		- we use to capture lessons learned
		- for the benefit of other projects
		                     the organization

* Lessons Learned
* Special Intervals

	At the end of the project:
	- Handover ('transition') of the deliverable.
	- Achiving of the project documents

	There are other actions that are NECESSARY.

	"Black out"
		* Once the deliverable functions as desired
		  and expected, we 'freeze' all changes
		* This is in expectation that it will behave
		  in exactly this manner once it is in its
		  final home.
		(Software development -> "code freeze")

	WE have a new server that will go online after
	the IT organization is ready.
		We take it through system testing, 
		functional testing, user acceptance testing.

		It passes all tests.

		We don't make any more changes.
		"BLACK OUT."

	"Go Live"
		* The deliverable starts its true work.
			- a server is brought online
			  on its network
			- a manufacturing tool starts
			  contributing to production
			- a new business process starts
			  its implementation
		* New functionality and bringing new deliverables
		  into an environment creates a risk of 'disruption'

		* making "go live" formal ensures we can control
		  disruption to a minimum.

	This extends our checklist:
		- Blackout
		- handover (transition)
		- golive
		- archive project documents

	We'll learn in next section:
		Generally in traditional life cycles
			this occurs at the end.

		Adaptive life cycles
			this can be a constantly
			repeating process
			("Multiple releases"

Empower Team Members & Stakeholders
	Empower	to 'hand over some of my power'
	("delegate")
		Does this make me weak?
		We'll decide at the end of this topic.

* Team Strengths
	- If I'm to delegate, i want to find what people
	  are strong in.

		They spent years becoming experts.
		They even studied when they didn't get paid.
		I get better results and greater engagement
		from people who are strong in their competencies.

		Even the strongest person has a weakness.

* Team Decision-Making Tools
* Brain-storming
Brainstorming

Identify a list of ideas in a short amount of time.
Conducted in a group environment, led by a facilitator.

	* identifying a list of ideas.
	* NOT YET ORGANIZING (analyzing) them

Facilitator, facilitate
	- to step out of the process
	- in order to ensure it is followed
	- ethical, as well as functional reasons we do this.

	Much planning combines
		facilitation
		expert judgment


* Estimates
	Without historical information:
	* Assumption -
	- planning factor
	- considered to be real, true, certain
	- without facts

	* Benchmarks
	Benchmark: standard or point of reference against which things may be
		   compared.

		You ask an expert their opinion for a duration. They say,
		"I don't really know, but I've seen other planners use
		 about 5 days for such work as an intial estimate."

		1) this isn't an estimate at all.
		2) this is an external reference (without facts)

		Traditional life cycles
		- we use assumptions and benchmarks when we
		  don't have work history, and 
		- we replace this as soon as we can

		Adaptive life cycles
		- we use assumptions and benchmarks
		- because we don't have work history
		- ALSO because we can expect to change.

	* Estimates
		- I collect enough (and 'the right') data (work history)
		- I apply a thoughtful analysis
		- I generate a reasonably accurate forecast (estimate)

* Team Task Accountability
	Delegation of schedule planning.

	Traditional PM	-> scheduling includes knowing sequence
				and duration.

	Adaptive PM	-> we may not know sequence, duration

	We can still plan, track, monitor, analyze and
	control our progress.

* Retrospective
	Agile is not one discipline. It's a bunch.
	Agile is the umbrella.

	Agile is a mindset and an attitude.
	Scrum is one of many toolkits within agile.

	We apply scrum tools with the Agile mindset.

	Scrum tools:	"ceremonies"
			formal celebration, performed by a group

	Example of scrum ceremonies:

		Standup ("Scrum")	short meeting
					Start of work (beginning of day, week, work item, etc)

		* What did we do yesterday?		progress
		* What do we expect to do today?	Status
		* What do we think we'll do tomorrow?	Forecast
		* issues, risks

		this gathers a lot of data, information we
		can bring back into the work.


		Review			we discuss end of sec. 1


		Retrospective		short meeting
					finish of work (end of day, week, work item, etc)
		
		* What did we do well?
		* What could we have done better?
		* If we knew what we know now, what would we do differently?

		this gathers a lot of data, information we
		can bring back into the work.

		This ALSO gathers Lessons Learned...
		(What if I as PM just facilitated, and delegated the
			effectiveness of the retrospective to the team?)


* Evaluate Demonstration of Accountability
	We want our team to demonstrate accountability:
		Accountable: "I care about the results."
	We look for (evaluate demonstration of)
	- Are they emotional about the work?
	- are their opinions supported by fact?
	- are they willing to go through debate?

* Determine, Bestow Levels of
  Accountability

Train Team Members and Stakeholders
* Training and Coaching
	Training	the ALl-encompassing activity of
			providing growth in
				Competencies
				* skills	actions taken to complete work
						I can write an algorythm in excel
						I can design a business process

				* knowledge	information needed to complete work
						"Where do we keep our templates?"
						"Who is the person to release confidential
						 information to this project?"

				* attributes	character, behavior necessary to
						complete work
						- responsibility, accountability
						- self-awareness, emotional intelligence
						- conflict management, consensus, debate...

	Coaching: a 'type' of training
		I work with a trainee
		I guide them in developing a skill.
		When they demonstrate that skill,
		we're done.

	Mentoring: a 'type' of training
		I develop a relationship with a mentee
		I help a mentee by creating an ongoing relationship
		We discuss growth plans and strategies
		I demonstrate attributes and skills
		They have an opportunity to practice.

	Where coaching is great for skills,
	Mentoring is great for all competencies

* Training and Coaching Plan
* T-Shaped Skills
	General		Great as part of a team
	Specialist	Is an expert

	T-shaped:	says the same thing.

	Deep		in my expertise (skills, knowledge)
	Broad		in my ability to collaborate in a team
			(attributes)

	"Self-organizing"

====================================================
7:52 AM 12/5/2022

For Monday standup:
	Common reference books for preparation
	How to get them for free

	Do I have to read these books? No. My surveys have demonstrated
	using these as a reference is preferred, not just adequate.

	6e PMBOK came out 2017
	This was a combined guide
		* General PM Framework
		* Process Group (Traditional PM) methodology

	2020	7e PMBOK Came out (General PM Framework update)
	2022	Process Group PG came out (traditional PM methodology)

	PMBOK			7e
	Practice Guides		Process Group (Traditional)
				Agile

	I recommend that you become a member for 1 year,
	and have access to free pdfs.
	As soon as a reprint is submitted, the pdf is updated.
	(I've gotten very used to using PDFs in my research)

	You want to be a member anyway for 1 year:
		1) many of you purchased a membership key.
		2) others should also consider paying for membership

		$129/139 (1 year's membership) gives you
		$150	discount on the exam.
		That's already a savings.

		ON TOP OF THAT.
		All published PMI materials are free.
		Access to their database for research is free
		Access to research material is free

		https://www.pmi.org/membership/business-reading-center


	Besides the documents, you need these two documents as reference:

	Exam Content Outline	(Tasks a PM Performs)
	Code of Ethics		Wrong, right, ethical behavior

	Crowe, Rita, et al are good interpretations.
	If they resonate with you, great.
	I prefer that you spend enough effort and
	gain YOUR OWN interpretation.

	Should I buy rita? That's a cost-benefit analysis you need to do.
		Cost can be as high as $90.
		Benefits? Lots of practice questions, descriptions of PM
		that are very unique, an entire preparation method.

*****
From:	Sec. 1, sl.  76
To:	Sec. 2, sl.   1

* T-Shaped Skills
* Required Competencies
* Elements of Training
* Training Options
* Training Cost & Schedule
* Pairing & Coaching
	Pairing:	Scheduling 2 or more people
			who went through the training together
			in such a way they can share the work that
			references that training.

			1) 2 sets of ideas is better than 1. 
				1+1 when it comes to knowledge
				> 2 (innovation)
			2) bonding occurs. You get growth in professional relationships.

* Certifications
	What about certifications that don't apply to the project?
	Great! It shows behavior of someone who I desire on my projects
		- self-organizing
		- responsible, accountable
		- purpose driven 
		- engaged in continuous improvement.

	"Raise people up, they take you with them."

* Baseline & Post-
  Training Assessments
	pmi.lochoice.com
		Have a specific pre-test and post-test.
		* try the pre-test; it'll give you a baseline
		  of your knowledge without training.
		  (It'll tell you where you need to focus most)

	From 2 decades of experience:
	- without formal PM training, almost Everyone has a score
		between 40 and 70%.

	- Our objective is 80-85% correct Consistently (not just once)

	lms.simplilearn.com has enough mock tests that you can
	use one as a pre-test also.

	Post-tests have more than one benefit:
	* Demonstrate the trainee learned.
	* Demonstrate the training was effective ('it worked')

* Ensure Training Occurs

Engage and Support Virtual Teams
	Which company can I look to for best practice in
	remote working and virtual teams?
	Git Hub: State of the remote worker Every year.
	Their *BRAND* is based on 100% remote working.
	They'll Never go back. Why?

* Collaboration Technology
	If you have the greatest remote working tools
	you still may fail.

	Tools are a WAY to get work done.
	The work doesn't change.

	The best tool is "transparent" (invisible)
	'If I'm configuring and worrying about the tools,
	 I'm not getting work done.'

	* some type of calendaring and scheduling <- 
		the way the calendars are represented in
		agile, traditional pm may be different - the
		fact that they have to be able to be shared
		by remote and in-office workers is the same 

	*	communication
		synchronous	- you and I are communicating at
				  the same time. 
		asynchronous	- I post a message, you read it when you're free.
				  YOu post a response, I read it when I'm free.
				  Text, Whatsapp, even community forums

	*	some central knowledge base everyone accesses
		Knowledge Management system that organizes and
		maintains project documents (and their information)

	*	some audio/video communications we can use
		both at scheduled times and randomly
		Even if we can only see shoulders-up of each other,
		this provides a great benefit.

		#4 accentuates something different from mere synchronous
		communication. It highlights the fact that video (observation
		through eyes) is necessary for communication that engages us.

* Why all this talk about leadership and team-building? Why the emphasis? Why not
  just schedule, scope, budget, risk, quality, resources, etc?
	Gallup research ("It's The Manager", with Jim Clifton and Jim Harter)

		If you are curious about what I discuss here, this book is for you.


* Virtual Team Member Needs
* Virtual Team Member Engagement
	Engagement, engaged: 'involved', participating, contributing.

	We think a manager's job is to remind people to get to work.	
	That's totally opposite of what our job is.

	Our job: "Influence and motivate" in order to create what
	people desire to naturally do.

* Communication
* Engagement Assessment
	The PM's job:
	* "Are my team members contributing?"
	* "Are they engaged?"
		'visible'
		'self-awareness, emotional intelligence'


* Communication Plan
* Implement Options for Engagement
* Calendar Tools

	'Time-box'
		a duration
		Not an estimate, but an assumption or benchmark.

	Assumption	- Planning factor
			- Considered to be real, true, certain
			- Without proof.

		Let's assume our early meetings will last 15 minutes;
		within the first few, we can see what the actual duration
		needs to be.

	Benchmark:	standard or point of reference 
			against which 
			things may be compared.

			"External reference point"

		Our organization has regular meetings set to 1 hour long.
		Let's use that as a 'benchmark'.

	Why time-boxes
	1) they set a sense of urgency. "We don't have all the time in the world.'
	2) They establish a baseline from which we can improve.


* Variance Analysis
	Variance	<->	DIFFERENCE
Traditional		actual compared to plan
Adaptive		WOrk complete / delivered to work remaining
			Work complete / delivered to assumption of ongoing work

	Yes - these tools work for others - especially our teams
	We can also use them for ourselves,
		"Leadging and managing yourself"

	Assessment of virtual teams:
		1) is the work progressing?
		2) is the team healthy, working together, delivering results?
		3) are the team members engaged, contributing?

* Virtual Team Best Practices

Build a Shared Understanding
* Project Vision
	Vision: "What does success look like at the end?"

	Product owner comes to you:
	'I just came from a business meeting, and have our new product -
	 It's the next version of our smartphone.'

	*) We'll start with an early release of the phone - just phone calls
	   and texts. This will get the model in the hands of the users (feedback)
	*) We'll then release the phone with better memory.
	*) We'll then release the phone with a better camera.
	*) We'll THEN release the phone with lots of apps.

	"Product roadmap"
	a 'vision' of an adaptive project life cycle that demonstrates
		multiple releases.

* Project Charter
	Project Document
	* Authorizes the project
	* Provides PM authority

	"High level"
	Later on, we'll create a PLAN that has the 'actual actions and steps'
	("Definitive")

	Sponsor		* stakeholder
			* provides funding, resources
			* source of decisions (primary)

	Your director:	'Can you help me put together this proposal?'
			They're asking you to assist with the project charter.

			'Here are the project details; please assemble a team
			 and start the plan.'

			A charter is in place, you get to find the details.

1980s
	"Mythical Man Month", Brooks

later 1990s, 2000s -
	Agile comes together as a *mindset*

	Primary difference in Agile:
		- focus on "Voice of Customer"
		- Focus on "Relationships"
		- Focus on "continuous correction"

	Scrum: Set of tools ('framework') (p. 99, Agile PG)


	Scrum:	A set of tools		(NOUNs)
	Agile:  An attitude/mindset	(VERBs)
		Together they make sentences, paragraphs and stories.

*****
From	Sec. 1, sl.  98
To	Sec. 2, sl.  23

Build a Shared Understanding
* Project Vision
* Project Charter
	- Authorizes the project
	- Provides the PM Authority

* Project OVerview Statement
	- Brevity, clarity (brief/clear)
	- Intent, vision

	Ex. "Build a Box"

	Director - 'There's a manufacturing tool on the floor. Every time it
	gets moved, a switch gets turned on. We can't have that.

	Go down, talk to some workers, and get an idea of what needs to be done.

	We can't afford to have anyone get hurt.'

	We'll follow "Build a box"
	We'll perform "build a box" in both traditional and Adaptive methods.



* How to Run the Project
	Selecting methods:

	"We know the work well; we just have to build on work history,
	 and by designing a robust plan, we can guarantee success."
			TRADITIONAL / "PREDICTIVE"
			(The plan is the focus)

	"We don't know the work - it's unknown, uncertain, and prone
	 to great change. We need to gather a strong group and working
	 with stakeholders quickly make decisions."
			ADAPTIVE / AGILE
			(The Relationship is the focus)
	
	COVID - we're on lockdown.
	A volcano goes off.
	Great upset.
	A unique business opportunity that might gain us
		the entire market.

* Kickoff Meeting
	an initial meeting to set expectations and
	gain project consensus

Context:	surrounding, background information
		assists us in comprehension

* Iteration Planning
	Iteration:	Repeat

Ex. "Release a new phone into the market"
	Product Owner: a role that owns the life of a product
	inside a company -
	* from its creation
	* to its obsolescence

	Product Owner: "Business and I have a great idea...
			* Let's release the new model as a simple
		  	  basic model - we can get it out and get
			  quick feedback
			* We can then release the model with better
			  memory
			* We can then release the model with better
			  camera
			* We can THEN release the model with lots of apps.

		Product roadmap. A 'vision' of the product release strategy.

	Agile
	* Standup: Scrum	beginning of work
	
	!!!	REVIEW		During work (iterations)
			* The team creates a 'prototype'
			* Stakeholders provide feedback

	This information is analyzed, organized and brought back
	to the product

	* Retrospective:	end of work

Prototype
	(7e, p. 246)
	- working model
	- to obtain early feedback
	- before product actually built

* Agile Ceremonies (Overview)
	'Ceremony' a formal set of actions performed by a group.

	Time-box:	an assumption, benchmark of a duration.
	How long should our meeting be?
		1) Let's start with 1 hour, and then modify it
		   based on need. (assumption)

		2) The organization holds 30-minute meetings;
		   let's start with that, and modify it based on
		   need. (benchmark)

	TIme-box: a duration assumption, benchmark. Why bother?
		* it creates a sense of urgency (we don't have
		  all the time in the world)
		* It establishes a baseline from which we can 
		  refine

	Sprint:
		* A TIME-BOX 	- does not describe the work.
				  DOES describe the duration
		* of 2-4 weeks. Short, enough to get some work
				done, yet create a point to
				evaluate

	ITERATION:	a REPEAT		* OF. THE. WORK.
	Sprint:		A Duration		* around the work

* Agile Ceremonies (More)
	Standup ("Scrum")	Short meeting	'Beginning' of work
	* What did we complete?
	* What are we doing today?
	* What can we expect for tomorrow?
	* Issues, risks?

	This information is gathered, organized, and brought into
	the project through formal change control

* Review (can be during or at end of iterations / "repeats")
	* Team develops prototype
	* Team demonstrates prototype to stakeholders
	* Stakeholders provide feedback

	This information is gathered, organized, and brought into
	the project through formal change control

* Retrospective	"Short Meeting"	(at the end of work)
	* What did we do well?
	* What could we have done better?
	* If we knew what we know now, what would we do differently?

	This information is gathered, organized, and brought into
	the project through formal change control

	Innovations ("lessons learned") are captured here

	1) These ceremonies are necessary for agile methods
	2) These ceremonies are beneficial for traditional methods

	I've discovered:
		- by describing something to others
		- and repeating that description > 3 times
		- I gain comprehension


* Task Boards
	Agile has a scheduling problem.
	In early planning, you don't have sequence or duration.

	How can you build a schedule?
	1) identify a high level "group of work"
	2) you use a way to get the work going and use
		it to explore the details
	3) you track progress...

	* Velocity: rate at which a task progresses
	* THroughput: amount of tasks we can work on at the same time.

	Water-hose
		- velocity   = 'speed' of the water
		- throughput = 'diameter' of the hose

	Kanban board: a special Type of task board.
	We'll review these later.


* Consensus
		Agreement		we share the same idea

		Consensus		* We may Not agree
					* We Will agree to support the team's
					  decision

* Reach Consensus (Voting)
	We have different 'ways' of voting, based on the question asked.

	* Yes/No?	"Roman" voting		THumbs up	yes
						thumbs down	no
	* A range of votes
		- I like this a LOT		open hand
		- I like this			close a finger
		- I don't care			one by one
		- I don't like this
		- I don't like this a lot	closed fist

	* a little conversation
		- We need some discussion
		  to understand context

	* when there are many many options
			"Dot" voting

			Options are laid out in a visible manner
			white board, paper on wall, etc

			Each voter is given a number of 'dots'.

			Each voter distributes dots across options

			some voters will place all dots on one option
	
			some voters will distribute across many options

			Dots of each option are tallied, and
			options prioritized.


* Estimation Techniques
	Assumption:	we have no idea of any history
			let's place a number and use that as a baseline

			planning factor, considered to be real, true, certain
			without proof

	Benchmark:	reference point provided by experts, good practice,	
			etc

	Estimation:	I have enough (and 'good' data)
			I have a thoughtful analysis
			I can derive a reasonably accurate forecast.

	Estimation in agile....
	- we have no understanding of duration - yet.
	- we don't have seqauences - yet.

	How do we estimate?
	"Planning" or 'Scrum' Poker
	- Story Points
	- T-shirt sizing

	What unit will we measure?

	Story Point
		a common "unitless" measure used in 
		relative estimating (7e PMBOK)

		Story point:
		* not a measure of duration.
		* IS a measure of whatever we want.
			(let's use difficulty)

	Let's go for a walk. We don't know how long that walk will be.
		(no expectation of duration)
f		Our experts can gtell us -
		We'll walk on sidewalks		Easy
		We'll walk through water	Tricky
		We'll walk through mud		Difficult

		Easy:		SMALL	work items
		Tricky:		MEDIUM	work items
		Difficult	LARGE	work items

		We have just prioritized - not by duration,
		but BY DIFFICULTY.

		Prioritizing, using small, medium, large -
				"T-Shirt Sizing"

		Let's assign units of difficulty to small, medium, large...

		small		3	story points
		medium		5	story points
		large		8+	story points


	Let's finish a 3 story-point work item.
	It took us 4 days.

	We can now Infer (FOR THIS PROJECT)
	3 story points		-> 4 days
	1 story point		-> 1 1/3 days

	We can now use this algorythm for an estimation of
	duration. It's not totally accurate, but better than
	plucking a number out of thin air.

	Not recommended to take a story point duration estimate
	from one project to another. They may not be relevant

* XP Metaphor
	Extreme Programming (XP)
	another method within Agile.
	Focuses on Software development...

	Software engineers are goofy.
	They love to name their files and file details
	titles:
			0x00_flp_rt_mmddyyyy

	Means a lot to the team
	Means NOTHING to stakeholders.

	Metaphor:	a way of describing something
			using an image.

	'Agile is like learning to swim'

	XP Metaphor	a naming method
			that provides names
			in a meaningful way
			to stakeholders - not only engineers.

	Instead of 		0x00_flp_rt_mmddyyyy
	Let's call the file	Little_red_button_bottom_closes_app

	Why go to all this trouble?
		This is not the engineer's deliverable.
		This is the stakeholder's deliverable.

	"Design of everyday THings", Norman
	Part of the advent of "User Centered Design"

====================================================
8:26 AM 12/7/2022


* Product Box

	You are
	 collecting requirements for a box
	with your stakeholder.

	PM:	What do you need this box to do?
	SH:	I need it to be 20x20x20 cm.
	PM:	No - what is its purpose? Its function?
	SH:	Oh - I need it black, and it needs to be made
		of the same material as the manufacturing tool...

	You have not framed the question right. 
	The Stakeholder does NOT know what they're supposed to provide.

		The TEAM Designs and builds
		The Stakeholder provides Needs, requirements, expectations.

		You have allowed the Stakeholder to confuse themselves.

	* instead *
	(one option)

	"Product Box"
	
	PM: Here's an invisible box - I'm handing it to you. It has
		no color or size; just tell me what it does for you?

		- how does it make your job easier?
		- What does it allow you to do?
		- What does it do for you that your current tools
		  can't?




* Reach Consensus & Support
  Outcome of Agreement

====================================================
Starting the Project
Determine Appropriate PM Methods &
  Practices
* Business Case & Business Overview
  Statement

	Economic Feasibility
	- Economic: values (business - revenue, profit, savings)
	- Feasibility: Can we even do this? Should we?
			will the organizatino support us?
	
	- Strategy	(roadmap)
	- Analysis	(benefits-cost)

	What if there's not enough information to pull together
	a business case?

	"Business needs document"

	Project Charter		Project Overview statement
	Business Case		Business Needs document

	Business Needs document:
	- 'We have aproblem that needs to be resolved...'

	We have a tool that's not safe. It keeps getting turned on
	when we move it.


* Project Implementation Plan

	Plan	=> "How we will..."

	Implementation: everything we need to consider
		1) for the deliverable to function in its environment
		2) for the deliverable to be transitioned WITHOUT DISRUPTION

	Disruption - getting in the way of ongoing processes -
			manufacturing, operations, etc etc etc


	Methods of planning:
	These apply both to Adaptive methods
	and Predictive methods

	Beneficial (often) for Predictive life cycles
	Necessary  (often) for Adaptive

* Rolling Wave Planning
	Starts with:

	Progressive	Progress -> move forward
	Elaboration	Elaborate-> add detail

	And then adds...
	* Current work - planned in detail
	* future work - left at a high level

	"Build a Data Center" 
	----------------------
	Application and Data Inventory
	Server and Support Architecture
	Power
	Data
	Thermal (heat) management
	Facility
	Physical and Data Security

	How many square feet shall we design for the facility?
		- we don't know.
		* In fact, we'll only know when we have planned
		  and finished the early parts of the project.

	Key to rolling wave:
	'Sometimes you need to plan and even complete
	 early parts of the project, even before you
	 start planning later parts ...'

* Progressive Elaboration
	"Build a Data Center" 
	----------------------
	Application and Data Inventory
	Server and Support Architecture
	Power
	Data
	Thermal (heat) management
	Facility
	Physical and Data Security

	Let's stop here. Let's all agree THIS is going
	to be our project. (* Consensus *)
	- Iteration 1 -

	Let's take this high-level plan and piece by piece
	work out the details
	- Iteration 2 - 

	Progressive	Progress -> move forward
	Elaboration	Elaborate-> add detail

		Iterative:	Repeats
		Incremental:	adds detail


* Overview - PM Methods
	Predictive:	Historical information is available
			Plans drive project success

	Agile:		Historical information is not available/we are
			 facing great change
			Relationships (reviews and iterations) drive project success

	Hybrid:		We may start off Agile and find out we DO have work history
			We may start off Predictive and find out we DO have great
			  change, complexity, uncertainty

			Various aspects of the project will be Agile, and other aspects
			  predictive

			Product Development:	Predictive
			Associated Marketing:	Very, very Agile


* Types of Life Cycles
	*PROJECT* Life cycle
		The cycle a project goes through from
		its approval to final transition

		CHARTER	- project approval
		to final transition

	We also discuss....
	Method, or Methodology	-> *PAY CLOSE ATTENTION*
		a 'way of completing work'

	Adaptive, predictive, hybrid are ***BOTH***
	Life cycles	describe the life of a project 
		AND
	Methodologies	describe a way of completing project work

	Predictive:	We have a solid plan
	Hybrid:		We have a combination of project needs

	Adaptive:	'Self-organizing'

	NATURE 	is adaptive
		one bird flies at random,	many birds fly in a pattern
		one fish swims at random,	many fish swim in a pattern

		one HUMAN acts at random,	many HUMANS act in a pattern
						(societies, culture, politics)

		Humans are part of nature, and therefore self-organizing.

		This ALSO means the WORK of humans is self-organizing.

	By nature, humans are agile. 
	Agile is a more natural way of getting work done.
	PRedictive life cycles are the unique way we have figure out to
	do work.

* Predictive Life Cycle
* Hybrid Life Cycle
* Adaptive Life Cycle
	When an author writes a book, they are performing an ITERATIVE
		project. (repeat, repeat, repeat)

	When a web designer releases a web site by pages
	When a software designer releases software updates ("Patches")
	They are performing an INCREMENTAL project (release, release, release)

	When we put iterative and incremental together...
	"Agile"

TIm is iterative more good than incremental?
	Is salt better than pepper?
	is hot water better than cold water?
	Are fruits better than vegetables?

	They are both necessary.


Plan and Manage Scope
	Scope:		HOW and WHAT
		
			What we will create		"The deliverable in
							 its state at the end
							of the project."

			How we will create it.		How we will create it.
							"the WORK"

		What	Deliverable
		How	the Work

	Scope:	both How and What
	Schedule takes scope (how and what)
		and places it in a 'when'

	Scope		how, what
	Schedule	when
	project charter	why
	Cost baseline	how much

	In small projects, we can plan how and what while we plan when
	In major projects, we NEED how and what (scope) first
				before we even think of when


* Scope Management Plan
	We first discover how we plan scope in Predictive projects

	- how we will
	* collect requirements
	* Build requirements into a SCOPE STATEMENT				????
	* DECOMPOSE scope statement into a WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)	????
	* BUIld our SCOPE BASELINE						????

	Project: "Let's bake cookies"
	* Validate Scope	'Are the cookies done?'
	* Control Scope		'Do we need to change the temperature,
				 timer, or recipe?'

* Project Requirements
	"HOW" requirements  (the work)
	* The box needs to be finished before February
	* We have only $65,000 to build the box.

* Product Requirements

	"WHAT" requirements (the deliverable)
	* The box needs to be black
	* The box needs to be 20x20x20 cm

	Product scope: 'The box has to be black and within 20x20x20 cm'

	These describe necessary components (and function)
	of the deliverable.

* Project Scope
	We use our project requirements to help define
	PROJECT scope

* Product Scope
	We use our product requirements to help define
	PRODUCT scope


	Scope is the RESULT of analysis of requirements
	* Requirements: the discrete components
	* Scope: the unified (integrated) whole

* Tolerances
	"Acceptable variance"

	Ex.	'We discover we need to cut a hole in the top of the box.'
		16.3 cm
		We can allow for +/- 1 cm	<- "tolerance"

	16.3 cm		+/- 1 cm
	Scope		Tolerance

	(We learn in quality)	Scope + Tolerance = "Quality Metric"
				16.3 cm +/- 1 cm  = "Quality Metric"


Major Planning Planning Factors:
	Enterprise Environmental Factors
	Organizational Process Assets

* Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)	(p. 38, Proc. Grp PG)
	- Constraints: "limiting factors"
	* We can't control them
	* They must be part of the project

* Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)
	- Process documents, Standard operating Procedures,
	  Knowledge bases
	* We figured out a good way of doing things
	* and don't need to figure it out again.

	- these make it easy for us to plan
	  and also give a predictable result

	EEFs are requirements we MUST include in the project.
	OPAs are good practice that makes our project better.

	If on the exam you see an OPA that is also an EEF,
	consider it as an EEF first.

	"PM Plan" how we will plan, do the work, monitor the work,
	 control the work, and hand the deliverable over at the end.

From	Sec. 2, sl.  34
To	Sec. 2, sl.  71

Scope Management Plan
	We first discover how we plan scope in Predictive projects

	- how we will
->	* collect requirements
	* Build requirements into a SCOPE STATEMENT
	* DECOMPOSE scope statement into a WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)
	* BUIld our SCOPE BASELINE



* Document Analysis
* Focus Groups
	Elicitation:	"Data gathering"

Focus Groups
	- pre-qualified stakeholders, experts
	- expectations, attitudes of a deliverable
	- a facilitated discussion for rounded information gathering

	"Build a University registration system"
	Objective - 'Integrate the registration functions of students, professors,
			counselors'.

	My stakeholders are students, professors, counselors.
	- I'll ask general questions to all stakeholders
	- and ask specific questions to each sub-group.	<- "Focus groups"


* Questionnaires & Surveys
* Benchmarking
	Benchmark:	standard or point of reference against which things may be
			compared.


* Interviews
* Decision-Making Techniques
	Why must we have autocratic decision-making?
	Are you going to allow team members to vote on safety regulations?
	This is why the voice of the decision must be supported through
	autocratic methods (ethics, laws and policies, safety, etc)

* 'Types' of Voting
		We desire consensus.
		We understand it's not normal for everyone to agree.

		agreement:		we all share the idea
		consensus		we may not agree
					- we will agree to support
					  the group in its decision.

		100% consensus	-> UNANIMITY
		THIS is very difficult to attain.

		What if you can't? What can you do?

		Unanimity		100%

		Majority		>50%
			1) what truly is majority? It can be 51,55,
			   66, 75, 84... We (the group) must decide
			2) We must decide before the votes are tallied.

		Plurality		Largest block of votes
					Even if not > 50%.
			Why? SOmetimes we have too many options,
			and votes will be distributed in such a way
			that no option has a chance of getting > 50%.

		What if *even with this understanding* we can't come
		to consensus?

		There are other tricks...


* Data Representation
	Affinity Diagrams
	- Affinity: 'categories' (Similarity)
	- Diagram:  graphical representation of information

	Example: a VENN Diagram (a 'type' of affinity diagram)
		* represents categories and how they may overlap

	Mind mapping
		* start with a group of about 18-25 people
		* Break them into teams of 5,6
		* have each one discuss the topic/s
		* bring everyone back together for a summary

		You'll discover
		- Everyone talks about some topics (general items)
		- A few will discuss unique topics (differences)

* Observations
* Facilitated Workshops

	Facilitated, facilitation
		- Someone steps out of the process (good for a leader to do this)
		  to ensure the process is followed

	Workshop
		-'extended' ("long") meeting


* Context Diagrams

	Context	- surrounding, background information
	Diagram - Graphical representation of information (report)

* Storyboarding
Storyboard, Story-
boarding:		Prototyping technique
			showing sequence, navigation
			through a series of images, illustrations 

	We document use cases through storyboards.
	Cartoons, jpgs, wireframes, any visual tool that shows
		sequence, navigation.


In Agile: we don't identify requirements at the beginning.
	We DO identify groups of work ("Work items") and
	their details.

	We use these tools:

Use Case
Describes and explores how a user interacts with a system
to achieve a specific goal.

	Example: "The student walks up to the registration kiosk, logs in,
			selects classes and submits for approval."

User Story:
	a brief description of an outcome for a specific user, which
	is a promise for a conversation to clarify details.

	Usually follows this format:
	"I, as a <<insert stakeholder>>, need <<insert need>>, in order to
	 <<insert objective>>."

	'I, as a student, need to register for my classes in order to take
	 and pass them, and then graduate.'




* Prototyping
Prototype
	(7e, p. 246)
	- working model
	- to obtain early feedback
	- before product actually built

	Agile: work item "determine size of box"
	* Let's just build a box out of paper
	* We'll use that to evaluate the size.


* Requirements Documentation
	- A project document
	- captures requirements
	- and their characteristics

* FUnctional / Non-Functional Requirements
	Functional:	the requirements that describe
			the function and purpose of a deliverable.
			'The box will protect tool users when the tool is moved'

* Requirements Management Plan

Scope Management Plan
	- how we will
	* collect requirements
	* Build requirements into a SCOPE STATEMENT
	* DECOMPOSE scope statement into a WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)
	* BUIld our SCOPE BASELINE

Requirements management Plan
	- How we will
	* analyze, document, and manage
	* our requirements

* Requirements Traceability Matrix

	There are 2 (TWO) project documents we use
	to manage requirements

	- Requirements Documentation

	- Requirements Traceability Matrix
	* Links requirements
	* From their origin (source)
	* To the deliverable

	Why? 
	It helps us monitor and control completion of our requirements.

	We've just discovered we don't merely track progress of schedule ("when").
	We can also track completion of Scope.
		We are done with this part of the work.


* Project Scope Statement

Scope Management Plan
	- how we will
	* collect requirements
->	* Build requirements into a SCOPE STATEMENT
	* DECOMPOSE scope statement into a WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)
	* BUIld our SCOPE BASELINE

Scope Statement:
	Project Scope
	Major deliverable/s
	Assumption/s, Constraint/s

	Assumption:	planning factor considered to be real, true, certain
	Constraint:	limiting factor (ex. EEFs)

	Example: "Build a box"

	Requirements:
	- Box will be black
	- Box will be 20x20x20 cm
	- We need box to be complete before February
	- We only have $65,000 to build the box

	Scope Statement:

	'The box needs to be black to blend in with the rest of the
	 manufacturing tool. It needs to be 20x20x20 cm in order to
	 fit over the switch, yet fit within the switch housing.

	WE need this box in production before Febuary. WE only have
	$65,000 to complete it.'

	Why do we need this?
		1) we need ONE statement that talks about the scope:
			All and only
			All the scope - what we WILL do
			ONLY the scope - what we will NOT do

		2) THis statement is what we will use to drive and
			maintain consensus.

	I've designed "Build a Box" to be a demonstration project
	for both traditional and Agile life cycles.
		the product requirements may be assumptions OR estimates.

	remember: we don't start off with requirements early in our Agile
	project.
			We start off with:
			* user stories
			* use  cases
			* Let's add one more factor -> "OBJECTIVE/s" 
				(purpose)

	The scope statement is not a document to make stakeholders wrong.
	When we have deviations from the scope statement
		- we approach this with curiosity
			* Why?
			* What changed?

* Product Analysis

	Systems a collection of processes and procedures
		often interacting with other systems

			a car:
			gas system
			fluid system
			electrical system
			turning system
			breaking system...
			AND how they work together

	Value	something to be held in high regard
		(something we're willing to sacrifice for)

	Analysis:	turning data into information
	Engineering:	building (construction)


* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) P. 268, Proc. Grp PG
	Hierarchical (top to bottom, total to pieces)
	* description of scope
		- deliverable	(product scope)
		- work		(project scope)

Phase
	A collection of logically related project activities
	That culminates in the completion of one or more
	deliverables.

	the 'big pieces' of the Scope Statement
	
WOrk	Work defined at the lowest level of the WBS 
Package for which cost and duration are estimated and managed.

	Project (Scope Statement)	"upgrade a cell tower"
	Phase:				'Construction'
	Work Package			'Concrete Pads'

	

* Code of Accounts
	- a numbering system
	- helps me organize and relate the different pieces
	 	('components') of the WBS.

	With a code of accounts and a WBS,
	I can start thinking of my WBS as a project INDEXING SYSTEM

		Databases have a schema
		a data format organization

	The WBS is the 'schema' of our Scope.

Standup: How do I use questions to improve my score on the exam?
	Scope Practice Question

	We will address all practice questions in class in the following 
	manner. It's recommended that this become a practice and habit
	as you transition to your preparation after sessions are over.

	Context:	Background, surrounding information

	Real Question:	What the question is truly asking

	Options:	Alternatives and their variances





The Team made an unapproved change, and did not share that change with
the PM. When the deliverable was next tested, it failed. This is an example of
poor:

Context:	- "Scope Creep" Change made, outside of formal change control
		- Did not communicate with PM
		- *ISSUE* Failed test.

Real Question:	What was the *root cause* of this problem?

a) change management
b) communication management
c) test management
d) integration management

		a - did poor change management cause this
		    and poor communication make it worse?
		b - did poor communication cause this and
		    poor change management make it worse?
		c - Did testing cause the failure?
		d - Did Integration cause the failure?- 

			Root cause analysis, and we are very confused.

		Process of elimination:
		C - is there any evidence that testing itself
			caused the test to fail?
		D - is there any evidence that integration caused
			the failure?

		We can now eliminate C,d

	Our job has just gotten really hard.

		It seems A,B are both right.
		WE can only choose one:
		a - lack of formal change control
		b - lack of appropriate communication

		Which one *caused* the problem? They both contributed.

		Let's try another trick:
		a - would we have a failed test if change was not
			formally approved? Possibly. 

		b - would we have a failed test if communication
			was the issue? No.

		The change created the source of the issue, and
		poor communication made it worse.

		A - the correct answer.

	This question is great: It tests you on your ability to determine
	root causes. I'll share more such questions with you in the following days.

Do I have to be deliberate like this? No. But it will be very very effective.
	Can I really get fast on this?
	Not in one week, but in 3-5 weeks.

	Once it becomes a habit, you can take this into your work.

	Expectations: This question is quite tricky. Not all questions
	will cause you to pause like this. However, practicing with these
	will enhance your skills.

So why are these timelines so stringent Tim? The classes could have had 
more hours added to it. Was there a reason why we had to stick to 36 hours only?
	Students expect to reach the minimum required hours to be able to take
	the exam.
		It is driven by students.

	If I could, I'd stretch this training out to a full year.

From:	Sec. 2, sl.  71	Code of Accounts
To:	Sec. 2, sl. 108

* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* Code of Accounts

007	If you can clearly define your scope (how and what), the rest of your planning is 
	really, really easy. The rest of your control will also be easy.


* WBS Dictionary
	- Extra non-scope data collected in scope planning
	- I can refer to as I go through further planning and control
	- (Organized by WBS and its Code of Accounts)

	Example: 	PM is leading a discussion on developing
			the WBS for the Aircraft system...

		2 engineers in the back:
		1 - "Didn't we use that German Engineering team for similiar
			systems engineering last year?"
		2 - "Yes - and I think it cost us about $35 / hr..."

		PM: 'Let's get back on track - we're discussing scope,
			not resources or cost...'
			(proceeds to capture this information in their WBS Dictionary)


* Decomposition
* Control Account
	- a management control point 
	- on the WBS			<- how and what
		(we usually organize our control accounts in the WBS Dictionary)

  Milestone
	- a management control point
	- on the ***SCHEDULE***		<- when


	Example:	Finance calls you up. 
			'We need that construction report for your facilities
		 	 every Tuesday morning, 8 am'

			"When" control point: let's create a milestone
			on the schedule


			Finance also says:
			'Don't break the report out by building. Just give
			 us a summary'

			"Level of detail" control point. Let's create a
			 control account on the WBS.

	* Control: Analysis, meetings, decisions, governance, compliance
		   review....


	Control accounts can add an extra level of reporting on your project...

	
	Scope Statement		"Upgrade a cell tower"
	  Phase			"Construction"
	    Control Account	"Physical construction" (not software design)
	      Work Package	"Concrete work"

	Now, I can report at 4 levels, not just 3.

	What if I have a thousand Work Packages? How can I manage this?

* Planning Package

	Scope Statement		"Upgrade a cell tower"
	  Phase			"Construction"
	    Control Account	"Physical construction" (not software design)
	      Planning Package	"Work Site preparation construction"
	        Work Package	"Concrete work"

* Work Package
	Scope Statement		"Upgrade a cell tower"
	  Phase			"Construction"
	    Work Package	"Concrete work"


	Here is the *Secret*
		WBS, WBS Dictionary
		Code of accounts, Control Accounts

		Allow us to create a fantastic database
		of all our project data.


* Scope Baseline
	* Scope Statement
	* WBS
	* WBS Dictionary

	WE get formal approval on this.

	Baseline:	initial project estimate (Scope, Schedule, Cost)
			used in further planning and control.

	*** NOTE ***
	- Once baselines are established
	  we enable (TURN ON) formal change control.

	  The baselines are pieces of our PM Plan

* User Stories (and Use Cases)
	1) we don't want to start with requirements in Agile.
	   WE start off with

Use Case
Describes and explores how a user interacts with a system
to achieve a specific goal.

User Story:
	a brief description of an outcome for a specific user, which
	is a promise for a conversation to clarify details.
	"I, as a student, need to register for my classes, in order to
		take them and graduate."

	What do have in Agile that is sort of like work packages?
	Feature
	"A service that fulfills a stakeholder need"
		NOT a Requirement.

	A release: basic smartphone

		Features:
		* the phone's frame
		* the phone's glass
		* the phone's operating system
		* the phone's telephone app
		* the phone's text app

	Is there something like phases in Agile?

Epic
    * a large, related body of work (sounds like a phase)
    * intended to hierarchically organize 
    * a set of requirements and business outcomes

		- Hardware epic	
			* the phone's frame
			* the phone's glass
		- Software epic
			* the phone's operating system
			* the phone's telephone app
			* the phone's text app

Why? We need to organize Agile work just like we organize
	our traditional work.


	This is a rule of thumb, not an absolute law.

		Features tend to be one or a very few
		user stories

		Epics tend to be collections of
		user stories and/or features

Traditional	Adaptive
=================================

* Tools & Techniques - Verifying Scope


Acceptance Criteria
	a set of conditions
	required to be met
	before deliverables are accepted

Definition of Done
	Criteria needing to be met
	so that a deliverable can be considered
	ready for customer use


Acceptance Criteria:	conditions that say:
			"We completed all the work"

Definition of Done:	conditions that say:
			"The customer can use this now" (it's functional)

	User acceptance testing does *2* things
		* Demonstrates requirements are met:
			acceptance criteria			<- acceptance criteria
		* Demonstrates the deliverable is functional
			Definition of Done			<- Definition of Done

	If we allow random scope creep in our discussion, we will not finish.
	WE'll talk about quality later, but...
		SCOPE		Completing all the work
		QUALITY		Doing the work *correctly*

Definition of Ready
	Criteria needing to be met
	so that a deliverable can be considered
	ready for team to start the work
	"The team has everything they need to start working"

Variance Analysis
	"Difference"
	Traditional
	  Actual progress compared to plan

	Adaptive
	  Completed and delivered compared to benchmark
	  Progress and status (velocity) to ongoing expectations
	  Completed and delivered compared to remaining work

Trend Analysis
"Pattern over time"

	WE take status (current) patterns
	And based on assumptions forecast against them
		and then constantly course correct.
		we repeat, repeat, repeat.


Plan & Manage Schedule
	We take our how and what
	and put it into our "when"

	WOrk packages	=> "Activities"
				a small unit of work that includes
				* sequence
				* duration
				* resource

		Work Package	concrete pad
		Activities	mix concrete	(2 laborers, 6 bags mix, 20 min)
					then
				pour concrete	(1 laborer, 15 min)
					then
				smooth concrete	(1 laborer, 30 min)

* Project Schedule
	Graphical representation of work against time
	includes activities, sequence, duration, resources

	If I understand
		activities, sequence, duration, resources
		I can say
			* the start of the first activity is the project's start
			* the finish of the last activity is the project's end


* Benchmarks & Historical Data
* Schedule Management Plan
	- how we will
	- decompose work packages into activities
	- SEQUENCE activities
	- Determine activity durations
	- Develop a project schedule (schedule baseline, schedule model, etc)

* Schedule Management Considerations -

* Iterative Scheduling with Backlog		p. 25, Agile PG
		"Releases and iterations"	p.246, process group PG

From:	Sec. 2, sl.  97
To:	Sec. 2, sl. 134


We discussed Agile Scope:
	Product roadmap
	* Releases
	* iterations

* Iterative Scheduling with Backlog		(P. 246, proc grp PG)

	* Uses progressive elaboration
	* User stories and use cases instead of requirements
	* PRIORITIZATION <- working on the 'most important work items' first
	* Team works as a group to finish each work item

	"Does not work well with dependencies with complex relationships"
		(if sequences are well-defined, we're better off with
		 traditional schedules)

* On-Demand Scheduling (Flow)			(p.105, Agile PG)
	* Team members "Pull" work from a queue -
		- a backlog with a 'stack' of work items
		- each team member just grabs the next work item
		  in the stack
		- "queue" or 'stack' refers to the backlog (release, iteration, feature, etc)

	* Team members grab work whenever each team member has finished the work
	* "Flow" scheduling does not require the entire team to work as a group

	Example:	"Build a website"
			1: grabs the front page
			2: grabs the 'contact us' page
			3: grabs the 'who we are' page
			1: is done with front page and now
				grabs the 'send us a message' page

	"Does not work well with dependencies with complex relationships"
		(if sequences are well-defined, we're better off with
		 traditional schedules)

Backlog: a 'group of work items' yet to be completed.
	Release		backlog
	Iteration	backlog
	FEATURE		backlog

when we talk about backlog, is there a possibility of picking up other release Iterations/features in AGILE 
	There always is an opportunity for change throughout an agile life cycle.
	That is beyond the discussion of these fundamentals.

	To delay this discussion is to remove future concepts from this class.

	* Where iterative with a backlog looks like a group of releases with
	  iterations,
	* Flow-based looks like a group of work items on a task board.


* Project Activity	(a traditional life cycle)
	most discrete unit of work
	on a schedule.

	Includes
	- sequence
	- duration
	- resource/s

	Work Package:	concrete pad
	Activities	mix concrete	(2 laborers, 6 bags mix, 20 min)
			   then
			pour concrete	(1 laborer, 15 min)
			   then
			smooth concrete	(1 laborer, 30 min)

	"Task" for our use, task is undefined.
	It is discussed as a 'container of work' in many PM software packages
	MS Project, P6, Sciforma....

	Your organization may discuss 'task', the exam does not. 
	The exam: 'activity, work package, planning package...'

* Feature (Agile)
Feature
	"A service that fulfills a stakeholder need"

	Built from the collection and analysis:
	- use cases
	- user stories
	- objective/s

* Epic (and Phase)
	"Large" collection of user stories....

	Features may have one or more user stories.
	Epic:
	- may be a collection of features
	- may be a collection of user stories
	- may be a combination of both

Traditional		Adaptive
Schedule/Scope Baseline	Backlog
Phase			Epic
Work Package		Feature
requirements		use cases, user stories

	This is how you'll remember the similarities.

	Defined features / epics:
	USUALLY a 'short phrase' (remember our XP metaphors)
		* size of box
		* color of box
		* basic smart phone
		* basic phone frame

	Scheduling work in agile:
		1) iteration-based: will include prioritization
		2) flow-based: each individual will merely grab
		   the 'next piece of work'
		3) all the work associated with that feature or
		   epic will be included.

can you pls explain how the schedule is similar to backlog? 
my understanding - backlog is work, schedule is timeline?

	Backlog is defined in agile scope planning,
	and expected to change throughout the project

	Scheduling of the backlog has to do with 
		- is there a distinct prioritization?
		- is there no prioritization?

	REMEMBER:
		Agile requires that each work item stand as its own set of work.

		If we require sequencing, or complex relationships between work
		items, we'll use a traditional schedule.

	"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL Scheduling?" THAT is what we discuss now.

* Milestones
	activity: a distinct unit of work on the schedule (predictive/traditional)
	Milestone: a 'control point' on the schedule.
		   a zero-duration activity that marks
		     where we need to apply control.
			* decisions
			* analysis
			* review
			* meetings
			* governance (authorizations) <- 'approvals'
			* compliance (confirmation we are following process)

* Estimating Project Activities
* Activity Dependency
	Sequence:
		Activities may follow other activities
		Activities may need to follow EEFs

	When an activity relates to EEFs,
	DEPENDENCY

	When an activity relates to other activities
		*** AND ***
		they relate between their finishes and 
		starts
	RELATIONSHIP


* Types of Activity Dependencies

	Mandatory	("hard logic")
			'Part of the nature of the work'

			"YOu have to wait for concrete to dry before you build
			 on it."


	Discretionary	("soft logic")
			'Based on the preference of the team'

			"We can build the servers at our desk, or take the boxes
			 to the lab and build them there."




	External	(outside the project)
			Relates to non-project activities/milestones

			"WE cannot start working until city hall approves the
			 blueprint."


	Internal	(Inside the project)
			'Within the team's control'

			"As soon as we've brought concrete mix to the work site,
			 we can start building the concrete slabs.'

	Internal, External denote locus of control.
	('dependency') "Where is the control of this activity?"

* Precedence Relationships
	Precedence: 'sequence'
	Activities that
		'lead'		PREDECESSORS
		'follow'	SUCCESSORS

	Relationship:
		- we have precedence between activities
		- and how their starts, finishes 'relate'

	"Precedence diagramming method" (PDM)
	- we have a documented manner of sequence
	* activities are on shapes (usually squares, diamonds <- milestones)
	* arrows denote relationship

* Types of Precedence Relationships

	Finish-start	in order for one activity to start, another must finish.
			"The concrete work must be complete; THEN we can start
			 framing the house."
			NO OVERLAP
			'Most common'...

	Finish-Finish	In order for one activity to finish, another activity must finish.
			"We cannot finish boarding up the walls until the electrical and
			 plumbing work is complete." (you can have laborers following
			 plumbers and electricians...)
			MAY have some overlap

	Start-Start	In order for one activity to start, another activity must start
			"We must start collecting data; then we can also start analyzing
			 it..."
			MAY have some overlap

	Start-Finish	In order for one activity to finish, another activity must start.

			- The night guard cannot clock out before the day guard clocks in.

			- The new server must be on the network and running before the old
			  server is removed.

			- We won't decommission the old manufacturing tool until its replacement
			  is in production.

			* there is some ongoing operation, function
			* CANNOT BE DISRUPTED
			* the current product / service is continuing
			* until its replacement is fulfilling this function

			* CONTINUITY

			Least common
			MOST confusing
			REQUIRES overlap


* Activity Duration Estimates
  (and Effort)

	Effort:		TOTAL WORK REQUIRED
	* 1 hamburger		 5 minutes
	* 5 hamburgers		25 minutes

	It doesn't matter if those hamburgers are cooked in sequence
	or all at the same time.
	It takes a total of 25 minutes of EFFORT.

	Duration:	TIME FROM START TO END
	* 1 hamburger		 5 minutes
	* 5 hamburgers		25 minutes
	* 1 cook 		 1 hamburger at a time

Hamburgers	Cooks		Effort		Duration
1		 1		 5 min		 5 min
5		 1		25 min		25 min
1		 5		 5 min		 5 min	(4 cooks having nothing to do)
5		 5		25 min		 5 min

	Duration can be compressed by adding resources.
	Effort will remain the same.



* Guidelines
	RISK - we discuss this in risk management. HOwever, as an introduction.
		Risk
		* might happen
		* if it does, will impact

		1) the risk
		2) impact
		3) *response*
			Response - a type of activity that is performed
				   if and when the risk occurs.

			If the machine overheats, we will cool it down
			and clean it.

		*) Reserve: The amount of time (and cost) required
		   IF the risk occurs, we respond
		*) Reserve analysis: estimation of time (and cost)
		   if the risk occurs, we respond

	The type of reserve we place on our schedule:
		*CONTINGENCY* reserve
		Reserve for "IDENTIFIED" risks

	When we study risk management, we'll discuss risk for UNIDENTIFIED risks
	also...

	it means Duration of R1 + Duration of R2 = Total Duration right?
		(duration Risk 1)+(duration Risk 2)+(activity duration) = total duration

	If You can identify a risk, you will be able to quantify it.
	Then, you will determine duration, cost of response
		AND ADD to the Schedule / budget.


* Schedule Presentation Formats
	Precedence diagramming (traditional)
	- Schedule network diagram
		sequence, duration, resource
	* GANTT chart is one example of a schedule network
	  diagram

	  HOWEVER, GANTT charts add one extra item...
		Portion complete as a percentage.
		*This* allows us to determine variance from schedule ('plan')

  (Schedule Model)
	Includes
	* Schedule Data		- raw data, from which the other model components
				are developed.
				'How many bulldozers do we need in January?'

	* Schedule Baseline	- my initial schedule estimate, used for further
				planning and control

	* Project Schedule	- my living, modified schedule as we progress;
				compared against the baseline

	* Project Calendar	- Documents NON-work time as well as work time
				weekends, holidays, vacations,
				8-4, 9-5, etc etc


* Gantt Chart
* Schedule Network Diagram
* Critical Path, Critical Path

	Note - much of the critical path method has been taken out of this
	material, and the exam has minimized its discussion.

	Critical Path:	Longest path.
			Determines project duration.

	Critical Path (CP) has no float.
			It has no down-time.

		ANY delay to CP activities will delay the project.
		That's why this path is called "critical"

Schedule management Plan
	- how we will
	* collect activities
		from scope
		in agile
		agile scheduling methods
	* sequence activities
	* determine activity durations
		(don't forget - contingency reserve)
	* build the schedule model
		- schedule data
		- project schedule
		- schedule baseline
		- project calendar
	* Critical Path / Critical Path Method


*****

From:	Sec. 2, sl. 125	About Float
To:	Sec. 2, sl. 162	Quality Audit

* Float

	amount of time an activity can be delayed
		* without delaying the end of the project
		* without delaying succeeding activities

	Activities on the Critical Path
	Will. Have. No. Float


	Total Float
	amount of time an activity can be delayed
		* without delaying the end of the project

	Free Float
	amount of time an activity can be delayed
		* without delaying succeeding activities

	Float: the amount of time an activity can be delayed
	It's a small duration that allows me to delay
		an activity such that
		- it may not delay the end of the project
		- it may not delay the succeeding activity

		"Allowable slippage"

	Each activity has
	- total float		amount of time I can delay this activcity
				without delaying the project end

	- free float		amount of time I can delay this activity
				without delaying a succeeding activity

	on the CRITICAL PATH (and on the CP only)
		* Total Float	= ZERO
		* FREE  Float	= ZERO

		There is no amount of slippage on the critical path
			- without impacting the project end
			- without impacting succeeding activities


* Agile Release Planning
	In scope planning
	* We understood the release roadmap in order to
	  look at THE WORK and THE DELIVERABLE/S

	In Schedule planning
	* We understand the release roadmap in order to
	  look at the RELEASE Schedule.
		* VERY HIGH level
		* ROugh estimate (ROugh order of magnitude)
	* We'll take this as an assumption
	* as we work through the features and epics
	  we'll refine this assumption


* Ongoing Progress Based on
  Methodology

	Traditional:	We compare actuals
			to the baseline

	Adaptive:	Total work accepted and delivered
			to work estimated

* Resource Optimization Techniques

	The resource use 		(our schedule with resources)
	will be less than or equal to 	('optimized')
	availability of resources	(resource CALENDAR)

* Smoothing & Levelling

	Leveling
	* we analyze resource constraints
	* we compare to schedule
	* if we need we 'optimize' the schedule

	"Our german software engineers are on holiday this next month.
	 Can we move their activities to the following month?"
	 If we can... we call this "levelling"

	Smoothing
	* We have pre-defined resource limits
	* We 'optimize' to retain those limits

	- Resource limit: 'noone will work overtime on this project.'
			(100% or less utilization -> 40 hrs/week)

	Engineer	Utilization
	----------------------------
	A		 45%
	B		 65%
	C		125%	<- we need to see if we can
				move this over-utilization to
				A,B...


* Schedule Compression Techniques

	There will be times when we need to shorten the schedule.

* Crashing & Fast-Tracking

	- Fast-Tracking
	* We move previously sequential activities
	  to parallel.
	* we may not be able to do this

		We are building a restaurant.
		We are finishing the landscape
		then we'll start working on the kitchen.
		Can we start the kitchen work before finishing
			landscape?
		If we can...

	- Crashing
	* We shorten activities for least incremental cost
	* by adding resources (money)
		- NOTE -
		We only crash on the Critical Path...
		- This will allow the project duration to shorten.

incremental cost comes from where ? contigency fund?
	No.
	Changes are not necessarily planned.
	Changes may come from directives from the organization.
	This means that as the schedule needs to be compressed,
		* we may need extra resources
			- people
			- material
			- tools
			- supplies
		* this. will. cost.

	Contingency reserve is a reserve set for responses
	to IDENTIFIED RISKS.

	These changes may not have been identified as risks.
	(and if they were, we're very very smart)


* Coordination with Other Projects

Plan and Manage Budget and Resources
* Cost Estimates
	- Cost	-> ACTIVITY cost (individual work pieces)

	- Budget-> PROJECT  budget (total project amount)

	Cost:	amount of money spent to complete work
	Budget:	- amount of money set aside		  (noun)
		- the process of setting that money aside (verb)

budget includes overhead and margin?
	Overhead	-> "Buffer"


* Estimating Techniques
	We use these techniques in estimating
		- cost
		- schedule
		- resources

	Estimate:
	* I gather enough (and the 'correct') data
	* I apply a thoughtful analysis
	* I generate a reasonably accurate forecast


	Top-down:	I determine a project-level estimate.
			--------------------------------------
			Fast.
			Not too accurate.

	There are *2* variations

	Analogous:	Estimating by 'analogy' ("history")

			"We've performed similar projects in the past,
			 and they've cost about $65,000. Therefore, this
			 project should also cost about $65,000."

	Parametric:	Estimating by 'parameter' ("history and a bit of math")

			"On other projects we learned it takes 10 days to build
			 1 km of road. This project requires 10 km, therefore
			 should take about 100 days."
			Parameter:	-> 	1 km road <-> 10 days effort


	Bottom-up:	I determine activity-level estimates
			and add them up for a total.
			--------------------------------------
			Accurate.
			Not too fast.

	There are no variations

* Common Estimation Types

	Rough order of Magnitude (RoM) Estimate:
	'High-level'
	Good for project charters
	Good for starting Agile projects

	-25% to + 75% of what I eventually expect the project to be.

	You have a project that will cost somewhere between
	10 MM and 30 MM.
		You don't want to spend 1/2 MM (500,000)
		determining whether you want to do the project or not.
		50,000 - 65,000 (3 engineers, 4-6 weeks) is very reasonable.

	Definitive Estimate:
	'Actual actions and steps'
	Good for a PM Plan
	Good when we are getting true clarity on an agile project

	-5% to +10% of what I eventually expect the project to be.


	Phased, Phase-based, "S"-curve
	We use the progress of of the work
	to determine the amount of money 
		we need *** OVER TIME ***

Initlly work vs budget should not tally?
	Let's say the first phase is supposed to cost 50,000.
	You spend 75,000 in the first phase.
	1) you may have misspent
	2) you may have completed some of phase 2 work
	3) you may have mis-estimated

		It is your job to determine which has occurred.

* PRoject Governance

Governance
	Act or process of overseeing control and direction
	of something.

	* decisions, authorizations
	* signatures, sign-offs
	
	"Decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem
	 that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social
	 norms and institutions."

* Compliance

Compliance
	the state or fact of according with or meeting rules or standards
	"Are we following process, procedure?"

	- QUALITY	<- doing work 'correctly'
	- safety
	- legal
	- health
	- community
	- health
	- organizational

	Governance:	authorizations
	Compliance:	authorizations
			  that confirm we're following process, procedure

* Lessons Learned Register
* Estimate Budget
* Cost Baseline
	My initial estimate (Scope, Schedule, Cost)
	- used for further planning and control

* Budget Challenges
* Repsonse to Budget Challenges
* Funding Limit Reconciliation
	Like a captain on a ship
	* we are constantly correcting our course

	"Funding Limit Reconciliation"
		* 'What are my costs (expenditures)?'
		* 'What is my budget (funding limits)?'
		* What is the difference

		Just like when we sit at the kitchen table
		balancing our checkbook
	
		as PMs we constantly balance the project budget.


* Anticipate Future Budget Challenges

reconciliation based on milestones/stage or continues process ?
	It depends:
		* Project Management Good practice?
			it follows the work (milestones/stage/phase/etc)
		* Organizational preference
			your department will have its own financing schedule
		* Business requirement
			Finance will require reporting and analysis at
			specific times

Plan and Manage Quality
	Doing work correctly.

	SCOPE			completing all the work 	('all and only')
	Quality			doing that work Correctly

		Scope	- COmpleteness
		Quality - Correctness

	Joseph Juran:	"Quality is....
				COnformance to requirements	Completeness
					AND
				Fitness for use			Correctness

		Fitness for use	-> It's usable. It functions.
			It can be used safely
			It can be used legally

* Quality
		The degree to which				Correctness
		a set of characteristics fulfill requirements	Completeness

* Quality Standards and Regulations
* Verified Deliverables
* Quality Management Plan
* Cost of Quality
* Quality Metrics
* Quality Audit
* Manage Quality

====================================================

Standup: Schedule compression exercise





*****

From: Sec. 2, sl. 155 Quality
To:   Sec. 2, sl. 192 Procurement Management Plan

* Quality

	Characteristics will fulfill requirements	Scope	Completeness
	The degree to which...				Quality	Correctness

	Example:

	* Requirement: We need a hole in the top of the box.
	  It needs to be 16.3 cm in diameter.		Scope	Completeness

	* Degree to which: Tolerance -
	  We can allow a variation of +/- 1 cm		Quality Correctness

	Scope		Quality
	Requirement	Tolerance
	16.3 cm		+/-1 cm

	"16.3 cm +/- 1 cm"	=> a "quality metric"


* Quality Standards and Regulations

	Standard	- a model
			* established by authority, custom, consent

	PM Body of Knowledge: a standard.
	It's not a set of rules and directives.
	"Good practice"
	(intended to be tailored)

	Regulation	- requirements
			* can establish characteristics
			* requiring compliance ('you have to follow them')

	De Facto	"Of the facts"
			* Widely accepted
			* Adopted through Use

		Telecommunications - the "Telecordia Standard"
		'You will tie down data cables every 18 inches.
		 You may tied them down with zip ties, velcro,
		 or waxed thread (and here are the knots).'

		If you don't do it this way, the deliverable won't
		pass inspections.


	De Jure		"Of the jury" (court)
			* Mandated by Law
			* Approved by Experts

		Telecommunications - the "Telecordia Standard"
		'When you drill a hole in a wall to pass a data cable,
		 you'll fill that hole in with smoke-stopping putty
		 or special metal plates.'

		If you don't...
		1) you don't pass inspection
		2) you've just broken a law.

* Verified Deliverables
	Verify		Quality	Correctness
	Validate	Scope	Completeness
	"Validate Scope"	includes User Acceptance Testing

				-> Direct & Manage	-> Deliverable
				-> Project Work
Deliverable			-> Control Quality	-> VERIFIED Deliverable
Verified Deliverable		-> VALIDATE Scope	-> Accepted Deliverable
Accepted Deliverable		-> Close Project/Phase

* Quality Management Plan
	- How we will
	* Plan Quality
	* Manage Quality
		- Are we following Process?	Quality Assurance ('compliance')
		- Are we continuously improving?Continous Improvement

	* Control Quality
		- Are we making defects? 	Quality Control
	 	  (inspecting for defects)

	Quality Objectives:
		Are we planning quality activities
		to ensure we're doing work correctly?
		Are we applying audits and inspections
			to find process deviation
			to discover defects?

"It drives me crazy when owners/managers say " i want quality built in" 
 and not think it requires additional, resources, time, cost 

	Quality is 'built into the way we do the work'
		not just added on as a few inspections and audits...
	Philip Crosby (TQM, 4 absolutes)

* Cost of Quality
	- Quality ALWAYS costs.
	* It costs to do work correctly
	* It costs to do work incorrectly
	* It costs *LESS* to do work correctly 

	Negotiating for proper quality takes time,
	effort, and only through experience, confidence
	and conviction can we start influencing our environment.
		3 magic words to start making a change...
		* Practice
		* Practice
		* Practice

	When 10s of billons of dollars are on the line
	(AMD, Intel) - executives finally listen.

	guarantee:
	"a formal assurance that certain conditions will be fulfilled, 
	 especially that a product will be of a specified quality"
	
	warranty:
	"a written guarantee promising to repair or replace an article 
	 if necessary within a specified period." 

	If the deliverable doesn't function as designed, I will receive it,
	work with it, and make it function - and I will pay for this.


	Liability:
	"Being responsible, especially by law."

	If my team, working on your work site, breaks a window -
	I will pay to get it fixed.


* Quality Metrics
* Quality Audit
	Audit: a type of inspection. Shows up -
	* Quality
	* Procurement (purchasing/contracts)
	* Risk

	Quality Assurance:	We *audit* the *process*
	- Precision		'Repeatability'

	Archery: If all my arrows are hitting the same part of the target,
	we are precise. We're doing the same process, over and over and over.


	Quality Control:	We *inspect* the *deliverable and data*
	- Accuracy		'How close to the target' (requirement)

	Archery: If THIS arrow is close enough to the center,
	we are accurate.

	"Get your repeatability (precision) down first. Only then
	 when you are accurate, can you predict accuracy - again, again,
	 and again..."


* Manage Quality
* Control Quality Tools
* Data Gathering
	- Statistical Sampling
	* Are we collecting 'enough' data?
		A 'sample'
		Do I need to talk to every human on earth
		to understand a fact about all humans?
		No.
		1) it's impossible.
		2) there is advanced math that demonstrates
		   there is a small pool or 'population' that
		  will give you mathematical confidence in
		  your analysis.

	* Are we collecting "the right" data?
		Variable samples	-> answer 'ranged' questions
					"Are we getting closer to target?"
		* precision

		Attribute samples	-> answer yes/no questions
					"Is this a defect?"

		* accuracy 

* Data Analysis
	- Root Cause Analysis


* Data Representation - Cause & Effect Diagram
	*	good for root cause analysis (RCA)
	*	good for Brainstorming

* Data Representation - Scatter Diagram
	*	2 variables
	*	correlation

	Does the scatter diagram mean:
	Time is making temperature drop?
	Temperature is making time progress?
		No. That would be *causation*

	This is correlation
	- there is similar movement between the
	  2 sets of data, indicating there is something
	  else ("root cause") causing this pattern.

	- correlation	- a third component is influencing
			  similar behavior in multiple data sets

	- causation	- one set of data is influencing the other

* Data Representation - Control Charts
	*	Control limits
		(specification limits)

	*	Rule of 7


	Specification limits:	boundary between
				- this is a defect
				- this is NOT a defect

	Control limits:		boundary between
				- this is within 'control'
				- this is 'outside of control'

		Control: 	the process is behaving:
				- normally
				- naturally
				- 'randomly'

	Central Limit THeorem (and the normal distribution)
		'If I have truly natural/normal / RANDOM data
		 It has a very distinct pattern...'

	Rule of 7: "If you observe a sequence of data above, below
		    target - even if within control limits - you are
			observing a process out of control..."

			What is the probability of a "rule of 7" event occurring?
			- (50%)*(50%)*(50%)... 7 times
			- (.5)^7	=> .78% chance of occurring.
				Very very low chance of occurring.	
				It may occur, but it's low enough for
				us to explore this confidently.

	For more 'rules', explore "Nelson Rules"
	And "Juran's QUality Book"

		For further information, Look into university textbooks:
			normal distribution
			standard deviation (how we set our control limits)
			and other details.


  Histogram ("Historical Diagram")
	* Vertical Bar Chart (up, down)
	* organizes data by category and frequency...




* Data Representation - Pareto Charts
	* Histogram, organized by frequency descending
	* Helps us understand the "critical few"
			(as compared to the Un-critical Many)

	Wilfredo Pareto - 19th cent. economist:
		"Economy of W. Europe"
		- 'The greater body of wealth is owned by the "critical Few"
			(critical Few-> 20% richest)

	In quality:	what if I were to organize
			my data in such a way to find my 
			project's "Critical few" defects?


	Preparing for the exam and pareto analysis ("critical few")
	1) what if you only analyzed questions you got wrong?
	   That's all right. The ones you get right now are
	   indicative of the topics you'll probably get right
	   on the exam?

	2) what if you organized your questions you got wrong
	   in a pareto chart? You'd be focusing on the topics
	   that have greatest influence on your score...

Standup:


*****

From: Sec. 2, sl. 173
To:   Sec. 2, sl. 210

	Integration:	consolidation, coordination, unification
			tying everything together.

	Example:	your director:
		
			I want it now		schedule constraint
			I want it cheap		cost     constraint
			I want it fancy		scope    constraint

		You say:
		"Thank you." (they gave you something - information)
		'Please select 2.'
			By selecting 2 constraints, the third is defined.

		scope, schedule, cost - not our only constraints.
		risk, quality, contracts
		resources, stakeholders, communication
		integration itself



Integrate Project Planning
* Integration Management
* PM Plan (p. 32-3, Proc. Grp PG)

* Project Integration Processes
* Project Management Information System
* Managing Change
	- Change will be formal. 
	- "Once baselines established, we turn on
	   formal change control."

	What's formal change control? WE discuss in sec. 3...

	Configuration Management Plan
	ALL projects implement configuration management....

	1) The deliverable must remain
		- consistent	provides the same results every time it's used
		- operative	demonstrates the function for which it was designed

	2) Which items (and which item details) need to be recorded and updated
		for this to occur?

		The items and item details that are recorded and updated in order
		for the deliverable to remain consistent, operative.

		* my tests and inspections (and their results)
		* my version control.

		"The tests, inspections, and version control that ensure the deliverable
		 remains consistent and operative."

	Configuration management works together with change management.

		Change management asks, "Can we make this change?"
		Configuration management says, "This is the result of that change."

	In 'small' (4-6 week projects) usually the team owns configuration management
		for the deliverable

		The PM will ALWAYS own configuration management for Project Management
		itself (documents, processes, everything about project controls)


	Change Management Plan
Change Control Board
	A meeting includes group of people accountable for reviewing, evaluating,
	approving, delaying, rejecting changes. Decisions are recorded and communicated
	to appropriate stakeholders.
	

* Change Management Plan


* Dynamic Change		(p. 99, Agile PG)
	- Scrum of Scrums
		* What happens if we're managing multiple work items
		  at the same time?

		- Each work item will have its own standup / "scrum"
		- we facilitate the integration of all these scrums
		  into a 'scrum of scrums'
			THIS is brought back into the backlog to consider change.

	- Disciplined Agile
		* a combined, predictive and adaptive toolkit
		  we can use to face any type of work.

		* We don't define each project as predictive, agile, hybrid.
		  We look at the work in front of us, and select the appropriate
		  tool.

	- Scaled Agile (Scaled Agile for Enterprise/SAFe)
		* What if my organization isn't ready for all parts of agile?
			- it likes standups and retrospectives
			- it doesn't like the time investment required
			  for stakeholders and executives.

		* Scaled Agile:
			* Let's assess the organization
			* Let's break down Agile into pieces
				- we'll release the pieces that make sense
				- we'll prepare the organization for the
				  other pieces

		Organizational Project Management

		OPM Maturity - how do I assess an organization is ready for
				more standard PM, Agile, and other ways of work?

Plan and Manage Procurement
	* This is a business discussion.
	- Attorneys, purchasing agents, finance will explain it 
          in a different way.

	- Purchasing, Contracts
	* Buyer, Seller
		"Seller sells,
		 Buyer buys."

		* Seller provides goods, services (deliverable/s).
		* Buyer provides fair value in return.

		For the exam, you will be the buyer.

	* Contract
		- commitment, obligation (supported by law)
		- a relationship (buyer, seller)
		- an exchange (deliverable for fair value)

	* Various Roles
		- Legal		own the interpretation of the law
		- Purchasing	own the 'processing' of the contract
		- Finance	own the movement of budget, funding
		- You (PM)	own the Procurement Statement of Work

		Decisions are driven by debate, voting and consensus.

* Procurement Strategy
* Delivery Solution
	You (the PM) have your own project
	- You take a piece of your scope out for bid
	- You find a seller
	- They have a project on that piece of your scope
	- The seller is PM for their project
		- you are sponsor of your seller's project
	- You are also responsible for integrating your
		seller's project into yours.


* Make or Buy?
* (Project) Statement of Work
		"Narrative description of work and deliverable"
		Narrative - as if we're discussing this over
		dessert at a restaurant.

	This statement of work used to be an input into the project charter
	As of 6e PMBOK it was determined that the business case also
	carried this information. The business case was retained, this document
	was removed.

* (Procurement) Statement of Work
	- the deliverable under contract
	- with sufficient detail
	- to allow potential sellers to confirm
	  they're capable of delivering

* Procurement Management Plan
* Source Selection Criteria
	- what are the criteria ("items")
	  necessary for me to select my perfect seller?

	* Attributes
	* Desired by buyer
	* for which a seller needs to meet or exceed
	* in order to be selected

* Qualified Vendors
* Bidder Conferences
	Vendor bidding and the entire bidding process
		- "Public"
		- "Fair and Equitable"
		* Ethics are a major concern for all 
		  when contracts are involved


		* Cost:	the amount of money spent to complete the work
		* Fee:  the seller's profit

		* Price: Cost plus fee (and sometimes additional risk)

	Bidding occurs as a series of requests and responses
		Buyer requests
		potential sellers ('vendors') respond.

	- RFI	Request for information
		Buyer: "We have work that needs to be performed.
			If you can do this work, fill out this packet
			and return it by ________..."

		The initial pool of potential sellers is selected.

	- RFP	Request for proposal
		With this initial pool...
		Buyer: "How do you intend to do this work?"

	- RFQ	Request for quote
		Buyer: "How much will this cost?"

	In many environments, RFQ and RFP are one 'request'.
	In many other environments they need to be separate
		discussions
		- a demonstration that price is only one component
		  for seller selection...

		Both sellers and buyer will find questions that
		need to be answered. Debate and negotiation and
		experts will assist. 

		Answers will be shared with everyone fairly.

		This will be iterative (repeat, repeat, repeat)

	* if there are enough questions, the buyer will call for
		one or more BIdders' conference
		an extended meeting ('workshop')

		Questions are shared, evaluated, and negotiated
		and answers are selected by consensus.

	The buyer will notice trends
	- some sellers start to look very similar in the way they
	  discuss and propose the work and price
		(this is probably a standard way of doing this work)
	- a few sellers will look unique
		* perhaps they have an innovation
		* perhaps they shouldn't be bidding
		- The buyer must make this decision

		The buyer starts eliminating potential sellers
		until we have a final pool.
		All the sellers will now start to look very similar.

	- RFB	Request for bid
		Buyer: "I'm giving you one last chance to be competitive
			 on price."
		This is *NOT* the buyer driving down the price of the contract.

	Buyer strategically analyzing:
		- Is the seller immediately willing to forego profit?
		  This is scary. ALl good businesses need profit and if
		  a company is willing withouyt analysis to do so,
		  they may need something else... (like cashflow)

		- IS the seller willing to walk away without the contract?
		* they possibly are the seller you want - enough work
		  and demand to not only stay in business but also maintain
		  a healthy profit...

	Upon receiving and evaluating final information,
		the seller is selected and announced, everyone thanked.

		The buyer and seller apply final negotiations, draw up
		contract, sign it, and everyone gets to work.

* External Resource Requirements
* Suppliers and Contracts

	Fixed	Fixed price, lump sum
		Work is well known
		The seller can do most of the work undisturbed
		The buyer knows EXACTLY what the price will be
			(price is in the contract)

		GREAT for Traditional life cycles

		If the seller spends too much or too little,
		the buyer doesn't care.

		The risk of cost changes is on the seller.

	Other activities?

*****

From:	Sec. 2, sl. 201
To:	Sec. 3, sl.   4

	
	Cost	cost Plus, Cost plus fee, cost plus fixed fee,
		cost plus incentive/award fee....

		Buyer: 'I need a fence. I don't know exactly
			what type of fence, but let's work out
			the details as you progress...

			"I'll reimburse you for costs."
			"I'll provide you THIS fee..."

		* the risk of cost increases are on the BUYER
		(they just negotiated reimbursement)
		* the buyer needs a way to ensure the seller
		  is conscious of controlling cost...

	There are cost mechanisms:
		Cost plus Award fee	achieving certain levels of schedule
					quality, or other metrics...

		Cost plus INCENTIVE fee
		Buyer:	"Let's agree on a target price.
			 when we reach the end of the project,
			 let's compare that to actual.

		Savings? I'll share it with you.	(80/20, 70/30, B/S)

		Overrun? I'll share *that* with you.	(80/20, 70/30, B/S)

		This places the risk with both the buyer and seller.

		*** NOTE ***
		At NO time will the seller be at risk of making no profit.
		If you are a buyer and allow this, noone will work with you.

	Time & Material
	* You need an expert: for a *short* time
	* not employment,
	* purchasing expertise for a duration

	Buyer: "I need you as an expert. For this part of my work, I'd like
		you to join the team. I'll pay you this hourly, daily, weekly,
		monthly."

		* if the seller makes purchase decisions, buyer must authorize.


	Contracts and risk:
	- seller's risk in a fixed contract
	- buyer's risk in a cost contract

		Fixed:	the price of the work is 'fixed' (agreed to in the contract).
		- the buyer will pay this and only this (unless contract change
		  is approved)

		- The seller may underbuy or overbuy
			(savings or overrun)
		- and it doesn't impact the buyer
		* it only impacts the seller.

			The seller retains the risk of cost overruns.

		Cost: buyer and seller agree for reimbursement.
			buyer is now at risk, since buyer agreed.
			the seller will have no control of cost, but
			the buyer retains the responsibility of reimbursement.
		
			The buyer owns the risk of cost overruns.


* Control Procurements
	- "audit" the contracts
	- Manage the relationship with the seller.
	- Review approved changes to your work,
		in order to determine impact to contracts.

* Contract Change Control
	'claim'
		'request to consider a change on a contract
		 must be resolved before the contract is closed.'

	Claims and claim management
	Owned and managed by the organizations (legal and purchasing)
	Your project will integrate that into your change management for
		the project.

* Types of Contract Changes
	Waiver, waiving:
		'Relinquishment' ("giving up") of a right.

	If I waive my rights to a buyer,
	I have given a buyer something they want.

	I am now in a position to ask for fair value in return.


* Disputes
		Dispute resolution
		"Alternative" dispute resolution.

		* We'll try to figure it out ourselves first.
		* If we can't, we'll split the cost of an
			arbitrator: a 'judge', but not really a judge
			and certainly not a court.
		* IF that doesn't work, we'll go to court, and here
		is the court, here's how the costs will be shared,
		and we'll get back together in order to complete the work.

Establish Project Governance
* Project Governance

Governance
	Act or process of overseeing control and direction
	of something.
	
	"Decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem
	 that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social
	 norms and institutions."

	authorizations, approvals,
	decisions, signatures.

	For the exam:
	*) We bring questions to the team.
	*) We bring advice to the sponsor.
		Sponsor: project decision-maker.

* Project Phases

Phase
	A collection of logically related project activities
	That culminates in the completion of one or more
	deliverables.

* Apply Governance to Project Life Cycle
* Phase Gates

	Gate: entry/exit point between territories
	*phase* gate: entry/exit point between phases
	"... a good point to apply governance..."
	*) close out previous work
	*) initiate upcoming work

* Phase-to-Phase Relationships
	Although currently "waterfall" projects are
				defined as 'traditional'

		historically:	'Traditional, where phases are
				sequential...'

* Determine Appropriate Governance

Plan and Manage Project/Phase Closure
	From the time you start a project,
		you have started closing it.

	* the activities you perform in closing a project
	  start as soon as the project starts.


* Close Project/Phase

	"when all the deliverables have been met, then the project is 
 	good to go ahead for closure activity"

	What is the role of the PM?
		'Ensure the deliverable fulfills /meets objective/s'

* Close Procurements
	closing contracts is not always closing projects.
	* sometimes we close the contract before the project ends
	* Sometimes keeping the contract open keeps the project open.

	Closing contracts is also part of 'close project/phase'
	- we may need to redefine 'closing project/phase'

	we may have multiple releases on our project, so we will
	be 'closing' throughout the entire project.


* Acceptance of Project Deliverables
* Payments

	In restaurant industry we have a concept:
		'Mise en place.' "Everything is in its place."
		Use something? Clean it up - now.
				put it back - now.

		Do this, and then the end of the night
		is only a checklist.

		THIS is how we approach close project/phase
			* WE are constantly in the process
			  of closing a project
			* in order to confirm that the project's
			  end will merely be a validation.

* Knowledge Management
* Using Lessons Learned Register
* Knowledge Management
* Transition Planning Artifacts
* Transition Readiness
* Close out Project, Phase



====================================================
Doing the Work
Assess and Manage Risk
* Risk
	- Might occur
	  if it does
	- Will impact

	'15% chance a company car will get in a wreck in any given month.
		If that happens, it will cost the company about $7,000.'

  Issue
	- Has occurred, is occurring
	- MAY impact

Positive:	opportunity
Negative:	threat

* Risk
	Example: opportunity and threat as risk...
	"Build a restaurant"
		now 4 weeks before the restaurant opens.

	Local sports coach: "Can you host a banquet in 
		2 weeks? I'll give you lots of money...."

	Opportunity		"... lots of money..."

	Threats			broken tables, chairs
				holes in walls
				menus might not be ready
				staff might not be fully trained

	a 'business' risk
		a combination of opportunity and threat
		in the same risk

		Are threats bigger than opportunities?
		Are opportunities bigger than threats? 
			That's the "business" decision.

* Trigger:
	'early warning system' for a risk
	Responding to triggers may allow threats to never occur.

	Example:
	Risk - 	'If the manufacturing tool overheats, we'll need to
		 clean and adjust it, taking 4 hours maintenance.'

	Establish a 'trigger'
		"Place a thermostat on the tool, and when a certain
		 pre-defined temperature is reached, allow the
		 tool to cool 15 minutes."

	Contingency Response planning:
	identifying and planning triggers

	Trigger:		response		Plan A
	Risk:			response		Plan B

	There is an effort to ensure responding to triggers,
	infers the risk may never have to occur.

* Risk Management Plan
	How we will
	* Identify risks
	* Prioritize risks	qualitative risk analysis
	* "Further analysis	Quantitative risk analysis
	* develop responses
	* monitor risk
	* respond to risk
	* continuously improve

* Cost Plus Incentive Fee exercise
	Cost contract
	Incentivization
		How do we reward and (lightly) punish
		for cost control?

Using the following information, 
determine the total price to be paid by the customer.

This is a Cost Plus Incentive Fee Contract. 

The sharing ratio		80/20. 
The target cost			150,000. 
The price ceiling		180,000. 
The target profit		 10,000. 
The actual cost			140,000.
----------------------------------------------
Actual Cost			140,000
Fee				 10,000
Incentive Fee			  2,000
---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
				152,000 <- total price
				Buyer wins	Below ceiling
				Seller wins	Extra profit


	Let's run this as an OVERRUN

The sharing ratio		80/20. 
The target cost			150,000. 
The price ceiling		180,000. 
The target profit		 10,000. 
The actual cost			170,000.
----------------------------------------------
Actual Cost			170,000		
Fee				 10,000		
Incentive Fee			- 4,000		<- taken from the target fee		
---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
				176,000		<- almost ceiling (partial win)
						<- a little profit for seller
							(partial win)

	This is not where the seller 'pays back'
	the profit.

	Consider this the buyer just being responsible for 6,000 in fee.
				
Incentive Fee:
	share ratio portion
	of overrun or savings...

	Savings? Overrun?
Target cost	150,000
Actual cost	170,000
-------------------------
		 -20,000	<- Overrun
Seller's share	  20%
		-------
		 -4,000


Price Ceiling: maximum price buyer is willing to pay.



* (Tim) Please review and document COntigency Responses (triggers)

* can Fixed price projects be in Traditional or both Traditional/Agile?
	Can I use an inflatable boat at the south pole?
		Sure, but it's better when it's used in warmer climates.


	You can use fixed price contracts, but it takes a lot
	of communication and it's not well-suited.

	Problem with contract change orders...

	- if it takes 4-6 weeks to establish a contract:
	2 parties
	each has attorneys
	each has purchasing
	each has finance
	each has decision-maker

	* it will probably take 4-6 weeks to manage a contract change.

	If I am crossing the desert, does that mean I should pack to
	survive in the snow?

	We were only debating whether fixed contracts were good
	for agile projects.
	They are merely not preferred.

	Cost contracts
	1) give us flexibility in cost
	2) engage the buyer and seller together (really good for agile)

Fundamentally
	Fixed contracts were designed for KNOWN work
	the price documented in the contract

	Cost  contracts were designed for UNKNOWN work
	reimbursement documented in the contract

* what type of organizations/sector are dealing such cost incentive contracts..
	Instead of thinking 'organizations', think of types of work.
	Research and development
	exploratory
	Pilots
	New breakthroughs in products, lines of business, and other
	unknown ventures.-

You are speaking from your experience
	I am speaking from
	* my experience (over 85 contracts with F100 corporations)
	* good practice
	* academic reference

* Disputes and how to argue
		- team charters
		- organizations
		- all relationships

	1) if you all agree, when you get to an argument,
	everyone feels more safe. They know the rules are in place.

	2) If you have rules and process, people feel more comfortable.

	In my last few job interviews, the interviewer asked me -
	'do you have any questions?'
		"let's suppose you and I don't see eye to eye.
		 How do you see us working this out, and 
		 how do you see us coming to a decicion easily?"

* (Tim) If the objectives are no longer required by sponser can the 
  phase of project can be closed?
	how and when to close a project early?

* a "clean" hand off to us in operations was always a question from project managers....the good PM's usually still worked with us till he depleted any question I could ask then it was onboarded into ops and maybe just a basic question from there
	- With Govt contracts we can't close when all the deliverables are done

	Deliverables being handed off is not always the end of the project.

I would think that "closing" as a PM can also be determined by company culture and if you are a "Contracted: PM or "Internal Employee" PM for the company....after all bringing me out of an office vs bringing me back as a consultant for matters has a cost difference.




* Is there something like negative float? Yes - it happens when
	the schedule changes. We can discuss.

* (Tim) an example of 'real world' configuration and change management
	working together...
* (Tim) an example of a scrum of scrums...



* I found that improved tracking in early life failure analysis 
  and a material review board helps lower these costs/losses
	Major construction helps here.

	(Tim) What can I do on MY project optimize raw materials?
		Kanban Board can assist
		(tim to build a kanban board example - "Just in time"
			raw materials)

* How can I get better at presentation?
	Practice.
	Get over making mistakes
		collect feedback
		and learn
		repeat, repeat, repeat.

	This can be done in Youtube, don't use it to
	be an influencer; use it for yourself and a very few
	friends you can show for honest, yet considerate feedback

* from Bhavya Bharti to All Participants:
A customer indicates that they would like to add functionality. Although this request is made during the execution phase of the project, the project manager finds that the cost for the addition would be small. The additional functionality, if successful, would increase the opportunity for profit. What should the project manager do next?
SELECT THE CORRECT ANSWER
Agree that the functionality would offer a great opportunity, but the proposed addition is out of scope.
OR
Schedule a meeting with the company's management team, and present the customer's request for additional functionality
	






* (tim) Can we once again review scope and schedule planning in agile?
* (Tim) Relationships:
	more examples
	More construction examples

* Why does mentoring play such an important part in PM?
	If I want a mentor, how can I find one (Kathy Caprino)?

	Kathy discovered: 1 of 6 managers has someone they can go to
	to confide in, solve problems with, learn from and grow with.

		Think about that. This means 1 in 6 of us has a way
		to learn about PM inside our company.

		How many managers are there in the world untrained,
		unsupported, uneducated?

* We completed all work --> u mean its not functional, how?
	In many projects, PMs may only sign off on requirements
	and neglect to ensure the deliverable is fully operational.

	This is why we discuss Definition of Done, not merely
	acceptance criteria


* what should PM do to avoid such scenario...as it was done by team members
	(scope practice question)

* good topic: and how/what format it should be represented...
  not always in gant format or specific software
		Traditional
		Adaptive
		Formal, informal
		Based on schedule assumptions

regarding estimation: PM delegates a team member to estimate... he estimated it wrong, project started, failed to meet deadline.
from Bhavya Bharti to All Participants:
Question is who is responsible for this - team member or PM
from Bhavya Bharti to All Participants:
and what will be steps taken by PM ?

  
* i want to know , if toleance should be known to all team member ...
  and where it will be defined...
	- General question: When is it appropriate to share information,
	  and what information is shared?
	- Is this an ethical or project success - related decision?

* Tricks when voting and the group can't decide:
		"Delphi Method"

* Why do we not look for requirements early in the project?
	- Lots of change: the requirements may change.
	- Lots of unknown: we need to work together with
	  stakeholders before we find requirements
	- It's all about the relationship (agile)
	
	Examples:
	:  i need to built a spaceship to reach Mars.
	:  Apollo 13. Heading back to Earth, a space rock
	 	pierces the capsule.
		the team has minutes and only trash to
		figure out how to patch the hole.

* Why 'story points', user 'stories', etc?

* how we can collect the requirement if the project nature does not 
  allow much transprancy in data sharing (as navy project)?
	When are projects good candidates for Agile?
	When are projects good candidates for Traditional methods?
1) Does Agile have a WBS?
	If yes, what does it look like?
	If yes, how do we build it?

	A flow chart talks about time.
	Time <=> "WHEN"
	A WBS describes
		- what the deliverable looks like at the end of the project
		- what work is needed.

* What does a WBS look like in programs / program management,
				portfolios / portfolio management
*   we learn two things today, Requriement management and scope management. 
    so wanted to know if is there any releationship (what?) between Requirement 
    and Scope?  
* Will scope of projects, programs, portfolios be different?

Is the agile methodology  needs better quality team than tradtional due to un certinty
from Kuldeep singh to All Participants:
post order managment = Project handle by PM
	What does project management look like in 10, 20 or 50 years?
	If this is what we're discussing now, what do we think work will look like then?

PMI is talking with gartner, forrester, and Standish group and trying to understand
	the PM roadmap.

	Go to pmi.org, and look up "Pulse of the Profession" (2022) 

Can PMP certification can be supportive to change the working industry?
	In my experience, it can.
	It can't change the boardroom today
	It *can* influence individual "hearts and minds"
		(that's how culture and politics are really changed)

* TIm is it possible we can switch from one domain to other after 
  getting pmp certification within project management

* can you please define what is "lifecycle"? the term
* Which of the following is a tool that teams can use to improve 
  and promote visibility?

  It is team charter right?


13. What are activity cost estimates made up of? 

a. Supporting data or additional information needed 
   to justify the cost estimates.
b. Estimates on probable costs necessary to finish project work, 
   including direct costs,labor, materials, equipment, facilities, 
   services, information technology, and contingency reserves. 
c. Estimates on probable costs necessary to finish project work based 
   on the responsive bids obtained from vendors. 
d. Estimates on probable costs necessary to finish project work, 
   including direct labor,materials, equipment, facilities, services, 
   information technology, contingency reserves,and indirect costs.

* How do I become a leader?
	1 - learn to lead yourself.
	2 - others observe you in your discipline
	3 - others decide to follow

* Who?
	Who creates and contributes to charter?
	What is PM's (general) role?
	Who approves, who creates, who designs/defines?

Q.> Does PMBOK 7 covers whole syllabus of exam as mentioned in examination 
  content i.e. (People 42% , Process 50% & Business Environment 8%) ? 
  Don’t see much about "agile",  "business environment" in PMBOK7,  
  does PMI provide the content for the same which we can refer ? 

Q.> What changes happened from Pmbok 6 to Pmbok7. I notice that Pmbok 7 
  look thinner than pmbok6?  Do we have any article/blog we can check , 
  which answer above questions.

Q.> I am little confused, structure of course is different in slides and PMBOK7? 
    Please help to make sense and how should we look at it ? 
	yes. It's very different.
	COMparing a training to the PMBOK
	is like comparing starting a corporation to Wikipedia.

PMIlochoice slides is structured as 
   -CREATING A HIGH-PERFORMING TEAM
   -STARTING THE PROJECT
   -DOING THE WORK
   -KEEPING THE TEAM ON TRACK
   -KEEPING THE BUSINESS IN MIND

PMBOK 7 structure 
   The standard for Project Managment
   -Introduction
   -System for value delivery
   -Project Managment Principles
   A guide to the project Mangement body of knowledge
   -Project Performance 

* (Tim) please review SLA, MOU, LOI, PO, etc etc etc
* (Tim) Difference between SOW and Contract
* (Tim) Build out a short article on Talent Triangle
* (Tim) In actual project a PM makes mistakes becomes escalation

* diff b/w enabler and deliverables ?
* (Tim) Hi Tim, my team is small, not skilled, does not wants to get skilled up,
  I am handholding them daily to finish deliverables. Any suggestion how 
  to manage them and get work done ?

* Tim: please review how to access slides.
* Please review operations (compared to projects)
* What's an artifact? Why is it important?
	can u clarify d difference between artifacts && deliverables  ??
	How is product different from an artifact?
* Why does Tim allow chat to be open
	There is a purpose.
* Why is Tim so patient with people?
	Aurelius, "Meditations", 2.1

* is there any difeence in code of conduct /ethics at organization level or project specific level
* * i have my PMP exam on 10th Jan, can you please suggest a roadmap?

* Tim, can you pls. share some recent information raditors 
  being used widely in industry?

* Tim, at the end of the day "IF" you have time would like 
  to hear another example and  how to handle an Ethical conflict 
  with possible contengency outlet path. (Only time permitting 
  later though,dont want to hinder).

* Please explain shared resource

* Tim: Please review RACI Chart (may discuss, may add as a response)
* What is a project, and do I need to do one? (review FAQ, but I will add a response)
* Ho9w do I deal with virtual teams?
* but what about "recommandations" of any vendor? that can be done by a director /employee?
	this way of thinking is entertaining and educational, and will
	get you a wrong answer on the exam. (ethics practice question)
* Can we be honest without being rude/ hurt?
* for the exam perspective, do i have to follow the PMI ethics (or) 
  which ever is good for the project
	for the exam, code of ethics and what is right for the project
	are. in. alignment. and yes.

from Edward Davis to All Participants:
good stuff!
from Dhananjay Marathe to All Participants:
Its good , now speed is needed. Request to all not to indulge Tim in unneccessary Long explanations. Please do some research offline also. sylabus is really vast and trainer is fortunately Good.
from aloke.kumar1@sbi.co.in to All Participants:
faster the speed, fast forward we forget what we learnt.. but with example we connect well and never forget the topic
from Edward Davis to All Participants:
naw you're good- you are giving me true application and in some instances where i made mistakes
* (Tim) Please write up another example of Applying Kano...

* Should we consider end consumers as stakeholders? They are directly impacted 
  due to the outcome of the project but not actively involved in the project.

* difference between outcome Vs physical a part of Deliverables

* Is this possible to get data from yesterdaz.. like u have shared now?

* What's a program? What's a portfolio?

* Tim - I have a question. Suppose at a later stage of project if a 
  stakeholder is no more impacted by the project, do we remove the name 
  from the register or keep it for monitoring?

* Hi Tim, Had one question? would appreciate if you could elaborate 
  the phrase with an example "Each task will have only one Accountable
		Review slide 15, sec. 1

* Generally activites get overlaps in real scenarios then pl explain 
  relevence of RACI chart or how it should be prepared

* Difference between data, information, reports

* deliverable is one of the artifacts which will be covered later, 
	What's an artifact?

* what is agile ?
* Code of ethics, and Tim's law of "The Necessary"
* Is it a right statement that PM should be more pragmatic to get the work done 

Generally activites get overlaps in real scenarios then pl explain relevence of RACI chart or how it should be prepared
		how do I keep up with documents when the project is moving so quickly?
		(let's discuss delegation)
Yes Edward, they spend entire day in research without any results. Again i take working session.
from Edward Davis to Tim Jerome (privately):
are you I.T. lol
from Prakash Amte to All Participants:
how to motivate team?
How to handle such situations as confrontation meeting could heat up the environment. This is already impacting team's environment and deliverable
Thank you Tim, Have a great time. Wonderful session. 
from Melody Clark to All Participants:
too many distractions, want to review
from KAILASH M to All Participants:
Can I post all the queries in the FORUM?  And also can I respond to others also in FORUM?Will the answers be reviewed?
from Edward Davis to Tim Jerome (privately):
haha, why i asked here or in forum. I have a few but will keep cool till end of week or when you answer those more direct to class. Thanks Tim
from JaishankarN to All Participants:
@Prashant - why dont you have a MOM and roll out to everyone. Just my thought
from Dhananjay Marathe to All Participants:
Is it that only Apple users have issues with Audio or connectivity ?
from HAFIZ MUHAMMAD AZAM to All Participants:
Do we have to capture positive or negative impact on the stakeholder register

It was really good the way you handled the chats .. this comes with lot of exprience .. need to learn that from you 
from Prashant Xavier Lopes to All Participants:
we don't use MOMs in 1-1
from Prashant Xavier Lopes to All Participants:
trust factors
from Edward Davis to Tim Jerome (privately):
-What weight/importance do you put into “team building” exercises with a project team you are managing? 
-What advice can you give a PM for being more “team engaging” vs “task oriented”.  Because of my technical/analytical background, I believe it is one of the biggest struggles I have as I get so focused on Executing on the “TASK” and not the “engaging/motivating” individuals.
-I’m working on “self-re-invention” and have gotten pointed in the direction (by Jim Rome podcast) of those like Aurelius and Ryan Holiday. What other readings/writers/podcasts would you recommend?
-What advice do you have for trying to locate “mentoring” within a company when you may be the “mentor”? Do you mean looking for who may be a cultural mentor (someone there a long time) or functional mentor?

from Raju Ramchandani to All Participants:
Tim request you to share this notepad notes the curre

* Why doesn't Tim just share his slide copies, his PMBOK,
	His practice guides, etc?
* Why does Tim have such patience?

* 	What is the best company for good practice remote working?
	Git is the loudest, and every year promotes a 
*  pushback in a conversation/discussion kind of Conflict?
* where do I get topic wise practice questions?

* end of class today (or post-session)
	our schedule compression exercise -

* Pre-recorded classes:
	- lms.simplilearn.com
	- this course (PMP Preparation)
	- "live classess" tab.
	- a link you click for recordings
	- if you have issues with recordings contact support.

* How to inbuilt the patience to solve 180 questions. I am loosing it in between 30-35.
	Practice:
	* Focus - Work on staying on task.
		You will not be able to pay attention for more than
		15 or 20 minutes.

		don't try to extend this, get used to your cycle
		of distraction for now.

	* Confidence - realize that confidence is a result
			of performing something multiple times
			and realizing the outcome.

		Confidence is NOT something you bring to
		an unknown experience

	* Time management
		start off with an understanding that
		you need to build habits right now, and as
		our sessions stop, get to that 80% correct,
		and Then work on getting faster and faster.

		you don't have to do it, but it is a guaranteed success.

	do it this way, you have a 95-98% chance of passing it the first time.

* Tim- how do i know which answer i got wrong if attend only 20-50 question daily (out of 180) from any simplylearn  assessment question.
		I would answer the questions,
		and use my bank of other questions
		for immediate answers.

* 12/16 standup: How can I stay busy preparing?
	we discuss how we can use the holidays to continue to learn.


* Are all the practice questions similar to the exam?
	Some exam questions are simple, some are difficult.
	- Since the exam's random, PMI ensures that every exam
		* is pretty similar in trickiness
		* more tricky exams are evaluated against that trickiness

	- If practice questions are tricky, good! They're exposing
	  what you need to cover.

* What is a bill of quantities?
	In RFI stage of bidding, how formal and how well-defined
	is it?
			BoQ is also sometimes called
			Bill of Materials (BoM)
			This is my list of physical, human
				resources (with associated cost)
			This is 'part' of the procurement statement of work
			- and is expected to be refined throughout the bidding
			  activities

	What does the PMBOK call this? (Tim)

* BOQ is comes under tender document.
	Can we discuss "Tender" and "tendering?"
* does the innovate bidder become the best choice?
	Very rarely, yes. probably 10% of the time.
		most buyers want a guaranteed success rate
		and therefore go with the good practice sellers.

* After tomorrow, we have classes Jan 3,4,5. We have a bit of a break
	- I'll send you off with a set of practice questions
	- if you run out of things to study or want to engage,
	  use the forum. I'll be monitoring.

* can switching fields from construction to IT
	It is feasible, usually complicated.
		There are small details in each industry
		that tailor project management

		moving from one industry is feasible, but
		some industries make it very difficult
		* to construction, to healthcare, to pharma,
		  to finance...

	Here's the trick: many PMs have become consultants and
	demonstrated their capability in multiple industries
	prior to transitioning.

	Another way is to get a supplementary degree in another
	area.. . (IT)

- holiday re-schedule:
Nov 28,29,30,Dec 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,12,
   13,14,15,16,Jan 3,4,5
	* Note * no classes between 12/17 and January 3.
	We start back Jan 3.

* Help! I've already scheduled my exam, and don't know if I'm ready.

	1) IMMEDIATELY - baseline your current score.
		Find what your current score is on mock tests,
		practice questions.

	2) consider your current progress - how much does your
	   score change over 3,4 days?
		across 3-4 days of daily practice (20-50 practice questions/day)
		review the 'defects' and document (write it down)

	   Determine your progress for 3-4 days effort.

	3) forecast that score against your exam date
	   to determine your forecasted score for thge exam

	   Use that progress to forecast your eventual score on exam day.

	4) if you're not at 80% (correct questions) by that date, you need to ask yourself
	   if you're willing to take on greater risk.

		Do I have confidence to take the exam?
		Do I need to reschedule?

* Is there a gap between 'real world' PM and the PMI General PM Framework
		The General PM framework as we discuss
		is MORE general than your day-to-day activities in PM
		- does not include organizational preference or
		  business requirement

		It does give a broader application of control than
		most organizations take advantage of.

* (Tim) How to become a trainer in Project Management?
	- What PMI desires of you
	- How Tim found a gig and created a career

	Many universities don't just have professors. They also have
	- "Research Scholars"

	PMP-certified Project managers have a minimumn of 3 years
	experience.

	It takes 5-10 years to really understand human and group
	behavior

	You can teach the mechanics of PM in the first 3-5 years,
	but what people desire you'll attain in the next 7.

	Project Management is not a quick fix. It is a study
	of continuing improvement. It's the long game, which
	in time is much more successful.

* Why doesn't the PMBOK talk about "buffer?"
	It's not 'good practice'
	PMBOK discusses	- contingency reserve
			  management  reserve
	THIS is GOOD practice.

	Buffer says, "Place about 10% of the schedule at the end of 
			the project, and use that as a 'buffer'."
		That's fine if you want a very simple fix.

		We want to be more accurate.

		1) we determine all our potential risks
		2) we estimate cost and duration of responses
		3) we associate them with the activities we
		   think those risks will occur

		RESERVE analysis.
		MUCH more accurate, precise.

* Margins generally represent PROFIT.
	This is good in business
	In projects you are a professional PM
	when you run out of budget and work at the same time.

* In rough estimation if it is going +75%, then we will not make any profit right??
		The intention of an accurate project is not to make profit.
		The intention of an accurate project is to
			estimate accurately
			and run out of work, money, time
			all at the same time.

		***VALUE*** can be considered a profit.
			However, we call value
			NOT a profit,
			but a *benefit*

	It's the intention of BUSINESS to maximize profitability
	It's the intention of projects to clarify the actual 
	cost of change.


* for preparing we don't need to refer previous PMBOK or v6 in specific just v7 is enough?
	6e PMBOK = Process Grp PG + PM Framework
		7e PMBOK	updated framework
		Proc Grp PG	is now updated too

		6e PMBOK is no longer needed

	6e PMBOK	was over 770 pgs.
	7e PMBOK	a little over 350
			  ONLY discusses the GENERAL PM Framework
			  (outside of methodologies)
	Proc Grp PG	about 370 pages

	For our purposes, we use
		7e PMBOK		general PM Framework
		Process Group PG	Traditional Methodology
		Agile	      PG	Adaptive Methodology

		Exam Content Outline	The Tasks a PM performs
		Code of Ethics		Behavior based on wrong, right





* What is the difference between Resource management and Project Management ? Do we study them separately 
		Project Management: integration of all the other
		domains of PM

		Resource management is the management of
		physical
		human
		  resources
		(only one piece of PM)

		PROJECT Resource Management *IS* what we call Resource
		management.

* I have not gotten feedback on moving last 3 days. It may have occurred, and
	if it is changed, here's what to do.

	- can you attend? Please do.
	- are you not able to?

	* Finish pre-recorded content from lms.simplilearn.com
		- this gives you your certificate credit.
	* follow up with questions, review the notes, and recording/s.

* in which category do the extra hours worked come..tim...
	This is determined by
	- organizational preference
	- business requirement

* tim, is there a chance for compliance measures dominating the regular work??
	* Yes, it's called 'optimal' quality
	* Yes, we can find that delicate balance before 
		compliance activities become more important than the deliverable.

* What would be % ?
	It depends.
	Copper cabling.
	Orange Juice
	Bacon

	CBOX:		VOX <- 'VOLATILITY INDEX'
			This is how volatile the market is today
			This is how volatile the market will be tomorrow.

	this is why executives have data scientists
	this is why healthcare has  actuaries
	this is why we understand that a probability and a range
		is a much better estimate than a single point.

* If Tim cannot just hand over a group of Templates,
	what can Tim hand over that will help a PM in any project?

* Does PMI have an associated Quality Standard such as production would be to ISO or foods to like FDA?

* Link to PMI PM Lexicon...
https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/lexicon

* We will confirm that the last 3 classes are moved to after the start
	of the new year.
  - right after class: What can we do with these last 3 classes?

	What if I already scheduled my exam and it's close? How do I
	prepare quickly?
	(Tim will write this up and discuss this week)

* Tim- in PMP exam , the question comes from mostly the definition 
  mentioned in this pdf material? or can be from any where like other books...

	How do definitions show up on the exam?

	There is a PM lexicon...
	- I do also refer to glossary/ies in
		* PMBOK
		* Practice Guides
		* Exam Content outline
		* Code of Ethics

	I provide too many definitions.
	I rely on the most relevant definitions according to
		academic reference
		"How university courses define PM terms"

	PMI has other book references:
	however, it has been demonstrated over 2 decades to me
	the PMBOK, practice guide, ECO, and Code are relevant enough
	to ensure a good understanding of the material.
	PLUS the class / course content.

	Follow the class content
	Use the guides and standard (and other documents) for reference.

* What's a good agile, traditional tool?
	Understand the fundamental concepts, you can use the following tools:
	- pen/paper
	- excel/word/ppt (google equivalent)
	- MS Proj, P6, Sciforma
	- Many, Many software collaboration environments

	Best tools practice:
	* synchronous/asynchronous comms
	* calendaring
	* centralized, standard project file storage
	* video Plus audio tools (along with item 1)

* I did not understand the difference fully(it’s fully confusing), Could you help in finding out the correct answer please?
Question 21:     Which of the following best describes the difference 
		between a lessons learned register and a lessons learned repository?   

	Definition question:
		Difference (variance)
		* LL register
		* LL repository

	Let's compare definitions:
	- Lessons Learned Register
		* Project Document
		* Captures lessons learned for THIS PROJECT	<-

	- Lessons Learned Repository
		* Knowledge Base
		* captures lessons learned for OTHER PROJECTS	<-
					       ORGANIZATION	<-

	Notice the way these are defined.
	My definitions have very DISTINCT variances.
	By carefully comparing definitions you will find your answer/s.

 
Option 1:       The lessons learned register contains issues; 
		the lessons learned repository contains the solutions.

Option 2:       The lessons learned register is the collection of all projects; 
		the lessons learned repository is specific to one project.

Option 3:     	The lessons learned register is specific to one project; 
		the lessons learned repository is the compilation of all 
		projects in the organization.
 
Option 4:    	The lessons learned register focuses on risks; the lessons 
		learned repository focuses on mitigating the risks.

	Scope, communications....

	Communications:		ECO Task 2.2
	Scope:			ECO Task 2.8

* Where are slide content?
	pmi.lochoice.com
	Download the slide pdfs

	ALSO download Mastery Builder

	Section 1	good quiz and short-answer questions
			for review

	Section 2	(practice questions)
			a good reference for more practice questions

	* Why doesn't Tim share his slides?
		- Tim made a commitment with PMI, Simplilearn
		- It would be unethical for Tim to share his slides
		- Tim teaches ethics
		- If Tim does not demonstrate ethical behavior
		  noone will believe TIm.

	Rahul's law of 2c	(my mentor)

* Where are review documents?

* Mastery Builder questions - can I have section 1 answers??
	I'll move section 1 answers to the folder today.
	I'll move section 2 answers to the folder tomorrow (I need to review 5 more)



* What are the important must read chapters & topics in PMBOK 7th edition
	Important must read topics in PMBOK 7th edition,
	process guide,Agile guide

	- The topics you are getting wrong on the practice questions.
	- You could spend time on each paragraph and learn a bit.
	- To raise your score the quickest and most efficiently, 
		* discover the tasks in the ECO you are struggling with
		  (using practice questions)
		* Look up the terms and concepts in the ECO Task
		* Search for those in the Reference material.

* Tim, how about the approach for legacy applications
	- Let's take this question in the context of change.

	Legacy applications:	they have been part of operations/production for a while.
	1) we may need to change/remove
	2) we may need to replace
	3) We cannot disrupt operations/production

	We have to understand a set of tests and inspections that consider
	not just the deliverable but also ongoing operations
	any change will have to be compared through those tests.

		* Configuration management *
		we explore this in integration (tying things together)



* Let's review Iterative, Incremental, Agile => Adaptive Methods
	- Iterative: repeats:
		* you often have work in projects that asks
		  you to iterate or repeat certain actions
		- update the deliverable and demonstrate to	
		  stakeholders (common example)

	- Incremental: adds detail
		* We often want to get basic functionality and
		  value out before extra details are in place.
		- INCREDIBLY beneficial in agile.

	- AGILE: combines iterative and incremental models
		into one model that uses benefits of both.

	All three methodologies belong to a methodology class called ADAPTIVE:
		* Self-organizing:
		* with small pieces, you don't see the big picture.
		* You pull the pieces together, and all of a sudden
		  the big picture arizes.
	This is the 'magical trick' that makes Agile so interesting to executives.



* Difference between project charter and Project Management (PM) Plan

	Project Charter		-> "Why"
		* authorizes the project
		* provides PM Authority

	PM Plan			-> "Actual actions and steps"
		* Describes how, what, when, how much, with what resources,
		* also risk, communications, etc etc etc

		necessary to ensure project success.

* whats the difference between program and project management
	Program
		- a group of projects
		- run as a single group
		- each of the projects have something in common
		- we can run them together to gain more benefits

		Physical resources:
		- each construction project needs 2 bulldozers (earth movers)
		- if I run a group of projects, I may not have to rent 2 each
			but use a smaller set to cover all projects (benefit)

* Post session:
	- Let's review practice questions
im- I tried projectmanagement.com, "PMChallenge" question and earned Genius badge by answering 20 question correctly today. unfortunately it did not tell/count the wrong answers that I gave during   assessment. 
How these 1000 question will help in PMP exam. 
Is that similar question (including difficulty level) can be expected in PMP exam? Please guide and elaborate!  

	* More practice questions:	Projectmanagement.com, "PMChallenge"
	  Please log in with your (paid or FREE) PMI ID. THis allows
				the website to track you.

	* EVEN MORE practice questions
		"Oliver Lehmann, PMP"
		Be aware, these are very very tricky.
		They represent an example of potentially how tricky PMP questions
		can get.

so , if i got the anwer worng.... waht is way to read that topic and where to make my understanding better for the exam?
		1) review the topic
			Our topic: quality, accuracy, precision
		2) Go to the Exam Content Outline (ECO)

			Task 7, domain 2 (2.7)
		3) Map it to our topics in our Dashboard
		4) Review the relevant documents across that topic
			You can also ask Tim


	Tim's constant Forum questions:
		* "I don't like that answer"
		* "I know another answer is correct?"
		* "Why must it be so?"

	- Let's review source material and
	  how to get it for free (again)

* Do I need to memorize all these facts?
	No.
	Why?
	Why Not?

		The exam does not test your ability to memorize.

		The examn DOES test your ability to think, act, decide,
		and control the various aspects of a project.

		If you do the math (180 questions across 3 domains)
		Understanding the exam is random:
			you can expect 4-5 questions on each ECO task.

		Understand the tasks? Pass the exam.

	Practice questions are not a 'nice to have'.

	If you truly want to pass the exam within 2 months of leaving this class,
	you will dedicate 30- 60 minutes daily reviewing practice questions (20-50/day),
	and looking up the questions you got wrong.

	this is the *MOST* efficent manner of preparing.

Tim- one more clarification please- in real PMP exam, does it tell instentely (in the same page, as it does in projectmanagement .com) that my answer is Right/wrong? 
	No. The exam does NOT tell you if you got the question wrong or right.

	The exam does not give you your score.
	The PMP Certificate does not have extra gold stars for a perfect exam.

	At the end, the software says,

	* In people, you were adequate.
	* In process, you were above adequate
	* In business, you were less than adequate
		AND you passed.


* Can we review incremental, iterative life cycles?
	How do they add up to Agile?

	This is why Tim takes lots of notes
	This is why we record classes
	This is whay we have post-session discussions.

* Project charter => Scope => Schedule.
	Charter	=> 	PM Plan
			- scope
			- schedule
			- cost
			- resources
			- quality
			- risk
			- contracts
			- communications
			- stakeholders

* What if I discover requirements later in the project?
	"Is it *NECESSARY*"
	1) Does it ensure project success
	2) Does it minimize project failure

	If one of these questions is answered YES,
	this requirement is accepted as a formal change.

We run the risk of great confusion when we use terms and phrases	
	we have yet to define.

	The slides use terms without defining them.
	This is why I take time before we can understand the slides.
		"Context"

* is that means product scope and requirement  same
	Is this what I said?


* Practice questions?
	I discuss sources next week.
	1) I reviewed common sources for this class day 1
	2) there are references in the FAQ if curious.

* What books do I need?
	I talked about these, and I talk about how to get them
	for free.

	Check out the notes

	Check out the FAQ.

* How far can I get in application before I need the certificate?

	To the very end.
	The certificate is only needed to provide the end of
	training (started here -> to end of here)

	Build your application now,
	when you receive your certificate fill in the last information
	and submit.

* 	If on the exam you see an OPA that is also an EEF,
	consider it as an EEF first.

	(practice questions, exercise on EEFs, OPAs)

* What's the difference between a project charter
	and a set of procurement documents? (RFI, RFP, RFQ, RFB)

* Let's discuss mastery builders...
I know we haven’t covered this topic yet- but need to know the answer for below query if you can?    
Also if you could share the keys/answer for mastery builder please? 
	I'll post answers to practice questions (starting p. 76)
	I'll post section 1 today aftyer class.

* is your classes sufficient to clear exam?
	There are additional efforts needed to understand.

	FAQ: How to prepare...
	I discuss this in week 2, 3, you can start reading right now.

* Can we review common business terms?
	yes, sort of. I'll give high-level definitions of terms
	commonly used across the last 2 decades.
In Consultant /Service Provider, Whether Client is Project Sponsor?

	SPonsor: ANYONE - person, group, entity
		provides funding, resources
		and/or is primary authorization

	Consultant, service provider, client
	are common business terms, and used in diverse
	manners outside of the PM Framework


* Can a sprint be other than 2-4 weeks? Sure.
	Organizations can say a sprint is 5 minutes.
	"Organizational preference"
	a common way we may tailor project details.

* Just for understanding how numbers are decided
	How was FIbonacci series chosen to define
	the number of story points in each t-shirt size?

* (Tim) Can we review story points and t-shirt sizing again?
		(is this a good exercise topic? Yes...)
* is project management domain specific? like software project management, infrastructure PM
		What's an extension to the PMBOK?
		(government, software, construction...)

* Apollo 13: a great example of Agile methodology.
	Post-session...

* from a business perspective, what generally are:
In Consultant /Service Provider, Whether Client is Project Sponsor?

* Can we review scrum 'tools'?
* you have mentioned "Common topics can be
          knowledge areas (in 6e PMBOK) or domains (in 7e PMBOK)." in Preparation process . Can you explain knowledge area and domain? Tim
	relationship of 6e PMBOK to 7e
	what are knowledge areas, domains?
* tim, please explain about the organizational structure of these positions with the PM for a better understanding
	If we are to do this?
	- federal government?
	- healthcare
	- education
	- Pharma
	- Fuel/oil
	- manufacturing & production
	.....
	We have to have a general way of doing this
	that incorporates all industries, sectors.
	(sec. 5, but I can give you a quick review)

* PMBOK and practice guides:
	do I have to read? No.
	Is there a really good way to use them? Yes.
	(In the FAQ, I genreally have a standup committed
		to just this)

* ok, in the coming days is agile going to dominate the other methodologies and be as one only methodology
	let me scare you. tyhe 5-10 year roadmap are even
	goofier than you can imagine.




====================================================
====================================================
7:52 AM 12/5/2022




* For tomorrow: Do I need to MEMORIZE all these facts?
	- memorization is one of many tools, but others are more important.

	* Good practice drives us to ask:
	"What are *the* facts that are holding me back the most? THose
	 are the facts I need to focus on..."

* Exam registration - we reviewed on first day.
  Start and fill out as best you can.
	https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp

  WE can review if it assists

* You can find cheaper copies on Amazon.
	HOWEVER,
	Look to the multiple printings.
	Check that out, and ensure you are getting
	the most recent print not just recent edition

* whats the pass %?
	PMP Exam	- PMI doesn't tell us.
	Why?
	The exam is totally random, and built when you sit down to take it.
	It doesn't change throughout your exam.
		- a perfectly difficult exam exists
		- a perfectly easy exam exists

	PMI, being fair, will not grade them in the same manner
	(this is ONLY one of many factors)

* Is there a difference between agile and traditional PM Tools?
		- Tools for working remotely? No.
		- Tools managing schedule, budget, communications,
		  Information? Maybe, maybe not. It depends.
			(most of this - a section 2 discussion)

* tool discussion:
		The best tools are the ones
		- I can use in PM software
		- and I Can also BUILD in excel/google equivalent

		We will learn many tools and techniques.
		Knowledge tools.
			models, methods, artifacts that are commonly
			used and have been demonstrated to be good.

difference between deliverable and tool:
	Deliverable	a result of performing work
	tool		is something we use in work in order to create 
			that deliverable


 Is any entity engaed having its own charter, i.e. sonsor chather, Contractor's charter etc..
* does CFT memeber aligned and update Charfer during Kick off?

	Possibly - this is an organizational topic. 
	WE use charters within the context of Project management

	- team charter:	documents and drives commitment on how a team is
	  to work together

	- project charter: authorizes project, provides PM authority

* Tim says, "This is a cat."
	Tim gets questions -
		* Big cats? Small cats?
		* White cats? Friendly cats?
		* What are the lengths of whiskers?
		* Should we think of kittens or adults?

	Tim says, "the exam is about cats, not these specific details."

	Project management crosses industries, sectors, cultures, nations
	such that it must be GENERAL enough to cover all equally.

	We can talk about how this impacts silicon manufacturers, health care,
	3rd world countries and such, but rememb er - we're discussing PM
	at a broad and high level.

* 	Curious about best practices remoteworking? 
	Look up Github; they are probably the best early adopter.
	They put out a best practice guide every year.
	
	https://github.com/readme

* Hi Tim, Where can I find the notes of prev session. I missed few classes as have some conflicts
	always in session notes, time/date stamped in order.

* Please sharen the Link of the dropbox where all the files are uploaded
	daily. end of class.
	(Files are there, and updated as of end
	 of class yesterday)
* Can we get examples of iterations, releases, backlogs, features, epics?
	I start this in section 2,
	but this is a great idea.

* yesterday someone said they had registered for the test in January, do you know how long it takes once you register to get an opening - if it is taking to January now, I need to go forward and register
	It depends. Go onto the pmi PMP application page,
	look up the details of PMI's associated test
	center relationship and you can start researching.


* Have the drop box link, but unable to find notes in there
	I validated - the notes are there, from yesterday,
	I update them again end of class.

* Hello Tim - Do we have weekend assignments to complete? If yes, great! I shall wait for you to share. If no, can you please help us with some parctice questions based on this week's class?
	I start more practice questions after we finish scope.

* Hello! How can we get the slides? The presentation? Is it something that we can buy?
  where i will get the all slide your presenting now
	It's available through
	pmi.lochoice.com
	if you purchased this, you have 2 sets of copies.

	If you are using mastery builders from lochoice,
	please tell me. and when you finished section 1 practice
	questions (p. 76), I have answers to share.

* LLR would be restrcted for team members?
	Let's test this theory.
	1) stakeholder asks to see it.
	2) I say it's secret.
	3) stakeholder no long trusts.

	1) stakeholder asks to see it.
	2) I say "bless you, ask me questions, if you need clarification"
	3) stakeholder feels engaged, and is very interested in this project

	Remember our code of ethics and its discussion of 'transparency'
	organizations and business requirement may
	require we keep some items confidential.

* Why all these silly formulas?
	We the arts (music, dance, theater, etc)
	to express concepts of culture we don't yet
	have words for.

	We the Math
	To express concepts of science
	we don't yet have words for.
		A language we learn to speak.

* Two of THE MOST overlooked actions done by leaders...especially owners of businesses and companies. Many dont make/take the time to "groom" anyone. No internal growth happens and ceilings get hit. Love this topic.

* Assesment in PMI... can u please show 
	"how do I prepare?"
		we discuss this in class weeks 2,3
		you can find details in the FAQ
	"How do I apply for the exam?"
		We discussed day 1, Happy to discuss
		discrete details
	"Where are there practice questions?"
		Documented in FAQ, I generally
		demonstrate end of week 2, or week 3

* Do you have a time that you will explain tacit
f	knowledge management, sec. 4

* Tim , We discussed about about the special intervals with concepts like Blackout , Handover , Go live . What is a Cut-over in this context ?
	cut-over is the process of moving from
		before-deliverable in operation
			to
		after-deliverable in operation
	- in scheduling
	- in Business value
	- sections, 2,3,4


Can you explain "how to do estimation for any com
	discussed in cost planning
	I go into a little detail of PERT estimation
	in the FAQ

* What's a passing grade?
	1) PMI doesn't tell - it's confidential
	2) Consider that the exam is random
		- there exists a really difficult exam
		- there exists a relatively simple exam
		- PMI being fair, wouldn't grade them in
		  a similar manner.

	I do know:
	GENERALLY when you are scoring 80-85% correct
	consistently on practice questions you have enough
	knowledge to pass the exam.

	You still need to consider:
		- focus (staying on task)
		- confidence
		- staying on task

 	Practice questions J(for now)

8:11 AM 12/1/2022


	How do we make a decision?
		Example: SHould this change be approved?
		"Is this necessary?"

		1) Does it make the project more successful?
		2) Does it keep the project from failure?
			'Necessary'

		If it fulfills that criteria, you can call it necessary.

		You can call this pragmatic, or stoic.
		It is ACTIONABLE.

	But tim, what if the project is successful and hurts the organization
	or stakeholders?
			That's not a successful project.




* Problems with keys? Membership, LoChoice -
	It is technical, and you need support.

	- www.simplilearn.com, click "contact us"
	- use local phone number / 24/7 chat
	- talk to a human
	- open a ticket
	- close ticket when happy
	- you get to reopen if you still have problems.
	- DON'T GIVE UP - be gently (and firmly) consistent.

* what if a PM is not doing his job in ethical manner, violation of rules 
  will be applicable there as well? or it is only for the team...
	4,000 years of common sense have dictated that the leader
	'should' be held to a higher level of ethics than others.
	The ones who promoted this were killed by the leadership.
		Socrates
		Seneca
		and thousands others...


* do we have to take PMP into reality (or)  consider what has been 
  drafted in PMBOK for reference to follow
		You get to choose. 
		for the exam, assume the PMBOK (and all other documents)
		are reality

* exam scheduled on 10th Jan
	Help! I already scheduled my exam. How can I quickly prepare?
	Take notes in each class, write down and understand your gaps well.

	after we have discussed quality, start using practice questions 
	actively - daily sit with 20-50 questions, and analyzing the
	results to where you need to focus. Consider a score of 80-85%
	correct a good target. (review preparation method on the exam)

* kindly suggest on the roadmap
* What books do I use? 
	7e PMBOK
	Agile, Process Group PGs
	Code of Ethics
	Exam Content Outline (ECO)

  How do I use them? 
	ONLY read them if you are driven to do so.
	I recommend you use them like wikipedia.
	Find the concepts you need to clarify
	Review the concepts in these documents
	and write down your answer.

  HOw do I get the books for free for free?

	Practice questions? I discuss this next week
		Please look for that discussion, and then
		you can go to town...
	(this is discussed in the FAQ)



====================================================
====================================================
8:09 AM 11/30/2022
For tomorrow - our first practice question
	(it's on ethics, and is a doozy.)



* Attendance doesn't show: You attended. If you are worried, contact support
	and they'll look up webex data.
	Webex data is system of record. LMS is a reflection.

* Recordings are in webex format (*.arf)
they REQUIRE the webex 'NBR' player.
If it doesn't download with the first recording, contact support.
	There is troubleshooting for Windows, Apple/IOS, even LINUX
	on the webex website, but Simplilearn has been working with
	webex for over 8 years.

* "WHO" does each part of work on a project?
	The WHO part will be answered in this way for
		** ALL *** who questions

	'Who' is unique for each project.
	- the plan will capture each distinct who
	- consensus will decide that 'who'

	1) organizational preference. Each organization may have their
	   'who' who does that work
	2) business requirement. Finance, legal, purchasing, etc
	   may require specific 'who' for certain tasks
	3) the PM facilitates, and experts, team, stakeholders
	   collaborate and decide, and the decision is captured
	   in the plan.


-- Post-session Qs
	THIS IS THE FIRST QUESTION
	. I am reposting my yesterday's question... The end consumer 
	of the deliverable should be considered as Stakeholders? 
	They are impacted due to deliverable but not actively 
	involved in the project...

	Let's see.
		end consumers will be impacted by the results of the project
		(if they are providing requirements and performing user acceptance
		 testing) they will impact the work
		If they think my deliverable is not worth purchasing, that hurts
		my work as well.

		yes, end consumers are indeed stakeholders.

		they may not be active stakeholders, but their perceptions
		and actions *are*

* Tim - you talk a good talk, but I can't do that inside my organization.
	How can I even donsider this?

	Think of your project as a little petri dish isolated from the
	organization. It gives you an opportunity to do little experiments.

	Don't do risky experiments in PM concepts right now; try a few simple
	ones. See what the results are, many will be mistakes. You will learn,
	and learn, and learn.	

* tim, QQ: but doesnt this conflict with our thiught process of influecing people 
	When we talk about influence and motivation, this will come up.
	Remember what I said - this exam and class requires a different
		mindset...

	Influence: ability to make things happen through others. It takes
	power (the energy behind that influence).

	What we are discussing gives us power outside of our rank.
	Here's secrete.
		You don't start teaching this stuff (leadership) to others.
		You teach it to yourself first.

		Evidence of leadership creates trust. It's a chemical reaction
		in our bodies.

		by leading yourself, you enable 'you' to trust 'you'.
		When others sense this trust, they also give their trust to you.

		we discuss
		'self-awareness' and 'emotional intelligence'

		I discuss outside of this class:
			self-learning
			learning how to read for growth
			the behavior of humans and groups

	You like what you hear? I learned this in 8 years.
	You will have an easier opportunity.

These notes are added to session notes after I leave this class.
	The most current notes will be on the online folder within an hour.

I have a deal for you.
	I will try to answer questions in order
	I'm downloading the chat log and will 
	pull out all the questions and add.
	If I don't get your questions, respectfully ask again
	tomrrow and I'll re-prioritize.

	You can use the forum, I may not be able to respond within 24 hours.

	I have this class and observe how many questions we have in one day.
	I ahve more classes than 1.

* How do I find a mentor? It's in the FAQ, and guess what - we talk about this
	in class.

* self-reinvention? The FAQ has a list of wonderful books, but I
	read them all and have an idea that applies to all generally...
	(peter drucker has the greatest advice)


* Tim, How do I get in touch with the Learner Management Specialist 
  (I’m having problems with audio today, so could you post here in the chat) 
		best way to interact with Learner success
			- in class: chat to 'host', 'Learner Success Manager'
			- out of class:
				* www.simplilearn.com
				* 'contact us'
				* call local number as posted on page
				* speak to a human.
				* I NEED HELP RIGHT NOW with webex.
				* Open a ticket
				* close that ticket when you are satisfied
				* if desk closes ticket before you are satisfied,
					- respectfully call back
					- reference previous ticket
					- ask for further assistance.



	You have a choice. You are a project manager. THink of whagt it would
	be like to lead a class and you're repsonsib le for 35 hours of material.

	If we focus only on discussion
	1) you don't get through all the slides
	2) you don't get your simplilearn certificate.
	3) you don't apply for your exam
	4) you don't get your PMP.

Is it mandatory to have atleast one 'Accountable' against one activity. I have seen RACI charge which did not have 'A' against some activities. Have you seen such scenarios...Tim?
	that's correct.

	Our material follows academic references.
	called 'good practice' - "we found out this works well, andif you do it
		that way, it makes it easy and very good for effective work.

	You may choose NOT to follow good practice.
		* organizational preference: organizations may have their own
		  way of doing work
		* business requirement: finance, legal, purchasing may
		  require you to do things a certain way

	This is called 'tailoring'

	Your organization is constantly tailoring

	this class discusses good practice (the exam tests you on good practice)

* I'm getting many, many many questions.
	I will answer all your questions in turn.
	For right now - 
	* Get paper and pencil (start a journal even)
	  and write down questions.

	* before break I'll review quickly
	* at end of class, I'll spend about 15 minutes trying
	  to clear them all up.

	* end of class I always share these and previous days' notes.

	If you all were 12 years old, I'd mute chat.
	You are not. You are managers, and have been so for 2-5 years.

	I also want to demonstrate how leadership has to engage and
	keep everyone focused on the objective.

	1 job for all of us
	*) Sit back, relax.
	*) Have a cup of coffee, tea, water.
	*) Listen, take notes,
	*) observe.

	You will be surprised.

I am so sorry, Tim - can we please take the questions in the end as planned please. This distracts the flow. 
	I get more private comments than I get public.
	They are also distractions. Please consider comments very ve3ry very carefully.

	IO understand the frustration and spoke to it day 1.
	If you are feeling we are not progressing, sit back, observe how tim is
	leading.
		Tim is exhibiting exactly what we are and will be talking about.
		"60% of the class is in observation."






====================================================

8:55 AM 11/28/2022
I have lots of open questions. If I don't answer them post-session,
I'll start answering them outside of class and leave the answers in the notes.
I can even carry some questions into the forum (you can too if you need to)

* We have to make PDUs by own or simplilearn will help me out?
	for the application you need formal PM Training -
	PMI calls this "Contact Hours"

	After you earn your PMP, you get to earn Professional
	development units (hours of ongoing training)
	I can show you where to get a lot of tho9se for free



Audio issues? Check chat log - it has instructions to trouble-shoot.

		* I posted the instructions for audio trouble-shooting in chat.
		* please review them.
		* please follow them.
		* if they don't solve it, then CONTACT SUPPORT

		www.simplilearn.com
		"contact us"
		use local number
		talk to a human
		(you can always use 24/7 chat off the web too) 

* Sir, will your note is enough to study and gain confident for PMI exam, or to follow any other text?
	I have a very simple, but thorough preparation plan. We will review it
	in a few days. For now, we merely need to sit back, relax and start
	getting comfortable together.

	The application process looks something like this:
	Phase 1: attend formal training.
		write down your gaps and obstacles, review
		and ask and debate.

	Phase 2: after classes over, go through 20-50 practice questions
		daily. Review the questions you got wrong, prioritize
		and review topics, concepts. 
		This takes 1 hr per day, and generally lasts about 3-8 weeks.
		your objective? score consistently 80-85% correct.

f	Phase 3: when your score is at this level, schedule your exam
		and schedule it out about 2,3 weeks
		continue daily practice,
		work on:
		* focus		staying on task
		* confidence	ability to forecast greater than normal success
		* time-management


* QQ: I didnt get what exactky you said about the self learning, pre-recorded content
		Self-learning is almost a self-contained class for this
		material.

		tim recommends:
		* go through the self-leaerning content as you go through
		  the live classes
		* you get the slide bullets AND you get context ('why')

Would you be giving some assignment for next session like for example go self learning chapter 1 & 2 

	I usually have an assignment daily, but always have 
	general advice at end of class

Should we attend all the PMP practice assessments to attend the exam?
	I already have a preparation plan that guarantees
	incredible success if. you. follow. it.
	We will review that later.

	You'll find about 20-50 * 7 * 3-8 weeks questions
	adequate to score 80%. 

* if I complete practice assessment, can I clear the exam?  so I believe after assessment we have to take exam right

* in order to get the simplilearn certificate, we need to go through the self-learning content, this ILT and complete two practice assessment exams 
	I already have a preparartion plan that guarantees
	incredible success if. you. follow. it.

	Honestly, 
	*) review the requirements for receiving SImplilearn certificate
	*) submit application
	*) review application recommendations
	*) review advice for tomorrow


	I can turn this into a question-answer session
	I can lead this leading as I have for years -
	answering all the questions you have for me at the right time.

	My advice this second:
	start writing down your questions.
	I will capture and respond to at end of claSS.
	at the same time, I already have your answers.



* What proof or evidence do I need in my application experience?
	evidence of degree
	evidence of formal training
	evidence of experience

	pmi will only ask for this if you are audited.

* Can I be part of a PMO and still gain PM experience?
	certainly.
	PMOs have both PM work and Operations work.
	PMI is interested in the PM work.
